\begin_layout Abstract
I develop a model of a decentralized matching market in which buyers pursue
 sellers by proposing jobs.
 No coordination friction.
 sellers have non-trivial preferences over jobs and independently choose
 what jobs to accept.
 Preference heterogeneity induces same-side and cross-side search externalities
 that generate inefficiently high levels of search activities.
 Platform's policy of coarse revelation of buyer information to sellers
 improves acceptance rates by decreasing the ability of sellers to “cherry-pick”
 desirable buyers.
 Implication for welfare-maximizing platform is to limit information to
 the side that is more patient and more substitutable.
 However, if this side has unobserved heterogeneity, coarsening is effective
 only if buyer-to-seller ration is large.

\begin_layout Abstract
I develop a model of a decentralized matching market in which buyers arrive
 over time and pursue sellers by proposing jobs.
 sellers have heterogeneous preferences over jobs and independently decide
 what jobs to accept.
 First, I establish that the equilibrium outcome is inefficient because
 of scheduling externality: by rejecting a job a seller makes himself available
 and decreases the other sellers’ chances of getting subsequent jobs.
 Additionally, sellers fail to internalize buyers' search efforts.
 Second, I show that the platform's policy of coarse revelation of buyer
 information to sellers improves acceptance rates by decreasing the ability
 of sellers to “cherry-pick” desirable buyers.
 This degrades seller match quality but improves buyer welfare.
 Notably, this information coarsening can be Pareto improving because it
 offsets the scheduling externality.
 Finally, I characterize the disclosure policy that maximizes the number
 of matches in the linear payoff environment and show that, compared to
 the static case, there are additional availability and patience effects
 that qualitatively change the form of the optimal disclosure policy.

Model of Decentralized Matching Market
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section I lay out a model of a decentralized matching market, in
 which buyers arrive gradually over time and pursue sellers by proposing
 a job; sellers have heterogenous preferences over buyers, seller capacities
 are limited, and sellers independently choose what matches to accept.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Spot matching process.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are three parties involved in the search and matching process: sellers,
 buyers and the platform itself.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is mass 1 of sellers, who always stay on the platform, never leave
 or arrive.
 The sellers do not actively look for jobs, but instead screen the buyer
 requests: each worker is presented with a sequence of job offers at Poisson
 rate, and he decides whether to accept or reject them to maximize discounted
 profit flow.
 An accepted job takes time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 to complete, during which time the seller cannot receive new jobs.
 
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is the search friction.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 At each moment a seller is either available and waits for new jobs, or
 busy with working on a job.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a continuum of potential buyers who gradually arrive over time
 at flow rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
 That is, within a time interval 
\begin_inset Formula $dt$
\end_inset

, mass 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta dt$
\end_inset

 of buyers arrive to the platform.
 Each buyer has a single job he wants to be completed.
 Upon arrival, the buyer proposes the job to one of the available sellers.
 I assume that the target seller is drawn uniformly at random from the pool
 of available workers.
 If the buyer's job is accepted, the buyer stays until the job is completed,
 otherwise he leaves the platform.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assume 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\tau<1$
\end_inset

 which implies that collectively, it is physically possible for sellers
 to complete every buyer job.
 The assumption makes the exposition easier and relaxing it requires more
 notation to deal with either automatic rejections or queues.
 I do this in  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Extensions"

\end_inset

 and show that qualitatively results do not change.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The platform opts out of the centralized matching process, instead it makes
 disclosure of buyer characteristics part of its design, as described below.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Heterogeneity and payoffs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two dimensions of heterogeneity in the matching market.
 First, each seller has heterogeneous match payoff across buyers.
 Second, different seller have different payoff functions over jobs.
 Concerning the platform's information disclosure problem, I need the following
 pieces of notation.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 be buyer type, with the interpretation that 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is the buyer characteristics 
\bar under
observed
\bar default
 by the platform.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Buyer type 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 captures the payoff-relevant information the platform elicits from the
 buyer about the job, passively from the buyer's cookies and queries or
 actively by asking questions.
 For example, on Uber, 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 would include rider's destination; on Airbnb, 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 would include guest's race, age and gender.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The space of buyer types 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 is a compact subset of Euclidean space.
 Distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 with full support.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 be seller type, with the interpretation that 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 is the seller characteristics 
\bar under
unobserved
\bar default

\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 status, race, etc.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The space of seller types 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $y$

\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is differentiable on 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

.
 Seller profit for one match is 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(x,y)$
\end_inset

.
 Assume 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 is continuous and for any 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 there is 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(x,y)>0$
\end_inset

.
 Buyer net match payoff is 
\begin_inset Formula $u(x,y)$
\end_inset

.
 Assume that all incoming buyers have non-negative match payoff:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
u(x,y)\geq0.\label{eq:buyer-net-payoff}
\end{equation}

Information Disclosure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The platform plays a signaling game with sellers.
 The platform observes buyer type 
\begin_inset Formula $x$

 Sellers do not receive any additional information about 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 outside of what the platform tells them.

 Full disclosure policy, denoted by

 That is, the platform can obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda'$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda''$
\end_inset

 by taking 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda''$
\end_inset

 and partially concealing some

 When a buyer of type 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 arrives, the platform draws a signal according to 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 and shows it to the seller.
 The seller knows the platform's choice of

\begin_layout Paragraph
Steady state.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A steady state of the matching process is characterized by the fraction
 of available sellers of every type and their acceptance rates.
 Formally, let 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha(y)\geq0$
\end_inset

 be the acceptance rate of type-
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 available sellers, and let 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(y)$
\end_inset

 be the type-
\begin_inset Formula $y$

\emph on
 utilization rate
\emph default
 – the fraction of type-
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 sellers who are busy.
 Denote the total fraction of busy sellers by 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\rho}:=\int_{Y}\rho(y)dG(y)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a steady state, the flow of sellers who become busy is equal to the flow
 of workers who become available.
 The available-to-busy flow is equal to the buyer flow type-
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 sellers receive times their acceptance rate.
 Since buyer get distributed uniformly across the available sellers, the
 buyer flow to type-
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 sellers is 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\frac{(1-\rho(y))g(y)}{1-\bar{\rho}}$
\end_inset

.
 The acceptance rate is 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha(y)$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the available-to-busy flow is 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\frac{(1-\rho(y))g(y)}{1-\bar{\rho}}\alpha(y)$
\end_inset

.
 The busy-to-available flow is 
\begin_inset Formula $g(y)\rho(y)/\tau$
\end_inset

 because the mass of busy 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

-sellers is 
\begin_inset Formula $g(y)\rho(y)$
\end_inset

, and jobs are completed in time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, in a steady state, we have:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\beta\frac{(1-\rho(y))g(y)}{1-\bar{\rho}}\alpha(y)=\frac{g(y)\rho(y)}{\tau},\quad\forall y\in Y.\label{eq:SS}

Seller repeated search problem.

\begin_layout Standard
Buyers arrive at flow rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 and get distributed uniformly at random across all available sellers.
 Therefore, each individual available seller experiences a Poisson arrival
 process of buyers, where the rate of the arrival is equal to the buyer-to-selle
r ratio:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\beta_{A}:=\frac{\beta}{1-\bar{\rho}}\label{eq:beta_A-1}

).
 There is thus a contrast between individual arrival process and aggregate
 arrival process in that the individual arrival process is stochastic while
 the aggregate arrival process is deterministic (a consequence of law of
 large numbers).
 More concretely, an individual seller faces a stochastic arrival process,
 such that over an infinitesimal time interval 
\begin_inset Formula $dt$
\end_inset

 the probability that one buyer arrives is 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{A}dt+o(dt)$
\end_inset

 Jointly, available sellers face the deterministic buyer arrival process,
 such that over time interval 
\begin_inset Formula $dt$
\end_inset

 the continuum mass 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{A}dt$
\end_inset

 of buyers arrive.
 As we show in the rest of this section, stochasticity of individual arrival
 process combined with independent decision-making creates seller coordination
 problem which results in matching inefficiency.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
There is an equivalent phrasing of the model which for some real world applicati
ons might be more relevant than the original phrasing.
 In the original phrasing, a buyer first reveals his information 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 to the platform, then the platform coarsely matches 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 to signal 
\begin_inset Formula $s=\lambda(x)$
\end_inset

, and finally 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 is communicated to sellers.
 Alternatively, I can phrase the model in a different way.
 Type 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 captures all cost-relevant information the buyer possesses.
 The platform's disclosure policy is then a mechanism that partially elicits
 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 from a buyer.
 That is, the platform gets to observe only 
\begin_inset Formula $s=\lambda(x)$
\end_inset

, and then 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 is communicated to sellers.
 For example, the platform asks three questions about a buyer need, which
 imperfectly describes what the buyer wants.
 In this reinterpretation, the platform's information coarsening corresponds
 to coarse elicitation of buyer information.

\begin_layout Standard
Rejection-intolerant buyers is a simplifying assumption that help to avoid
 endogenous distribution of buyer types.
 It captures the real aspect of matching markets that rejections are costly
 to buyers, e.g.
 wasted time, wasted search effort, bidding costs, etc.
 Moreover, buyers often do take rejections badly.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 reports that on Airbnb, an initial rejection decreases the probability
 that the guest eventually books any listing by 50%.

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of the paper is to explore the matching frictions that pertain
 to preference heterogeneity and screening.

 requesting the same seller and the coordination frictions owing to buyer
 requesting unavailable sellers.

\begin_layout Subsection
Seller coordination problem and crowding externality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This subsection establishes that the full disclosure does not yield a Pareto
 optimal market outcome.
 In particular, it is not efficient.
 The reason behind it is the sellers' coordination problem.
 The inefficiency arises due to decentralization and dynamic nature of the
 matching.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To state the results of this and next sections, I need to define Pareto-optimali
ty in my setting.
 Market outcome 
\begin_inset Formula $O=(\left\{ V(y)\right\} ,CS)$
\end_inset

 is a combination of seller profits and consumer surplus that arises in
 a steady-state equilibrium.
 I say that a market outcome is 
\emph on
feasible
\emph default
 if there is a seller strategy profile that generates it, and 
\begin_inset Formula $V(y)\geq0$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

.
 A feasible outcome 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

 is Pareto-optimal if there is no other feasible 
\begin_inset Formula $O'$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $V(y)'>V(y)$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $CS'>CS$
\end_inset

.
 The Pareto frontier is the set of all Pareto-optimal outcomes.
 We say that market outcome 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

 is 
\emph on
implementable
\emph default
 if there is a disclosure policy such that the equilibrium outcome is 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

.
 The welfare is the sum of consumer surplus and seller profits.
 A market outcome is 
\emph on
efficient
\emph default
 if there is no other feasible outcome with higher welfare.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Write 
\begin_inset Formula $V^{\sigma}(y)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho^{\sigma}(y)$

, 
\begin_inset Formula $CS^{\sigma}$
\end_inset

 for steady-state profits, utilization rates and consumer surplus when strategy
 profile 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is played.
 Imagine the platform starts with the full disclosure as its default disclosure
 policy.
 The next proposition shows that there is a feasible outcome at which sellers
 are strictly better off than under the full disclosure, they complete more
 jobs, and additionally, the buyers are also better off.
 The result implies that there is a coordination problem among sellers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "prop:indep-vs-coord"

\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{FD}$
\end_inset

 be the equilibrium strategy profile under full disclosure.
 Then there exists 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\sigma}$
\end_inset

 such that for all 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\tilde{V}(y) & > & V^{FD}(y),\\
\tilde{\rho}(y) & > & \rho^{FD}(y),\\
\widetilde{CS} & > & CS^{FD}.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The full proof is in the Appendix.
 Here I give the sketch of the proof for the case of identical sellers,
 which gives insights into the nature of the seller coordination problem.
 Under the full disclosure, seller profit 
\begin_inset Formula $V^{FD}$
\end_inset

 is strictly positive because sellers accept only profitable jobs.
 Therefore, the opportunity cost of accepting 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau V^{FD}$
\end_inset

 is strictly positive, too (see Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "eq:pi(c)"

\end_inset

).
 As a result, in equilibrium, the accepted jobs are those with profits 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi\geq\tau V^{FD}$
\end_inset

.
 However, the profitable jobs are those with 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi\geq0$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, some profitable jobs are rejected.
 Consider strategy 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\sigma}$
\end_inset

 that maximizes the joint seller profits.
 It prescribes every seller to accept jobs with 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi\geq0$
\end_inset

 (and this is feasible by the No Excess Demand assumption).
 Naturally, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\sigma}$
\end_inset

 yields 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{V}>V^{FD}$
\end_inset

.
 It also increases acceptance rate, and thus the utilization rates, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\rho}>\rho^{FD}$
\end_inset

.
 Consumers are better off because consumer surplus is increasing in the
 acceptance rate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A very high-level intuition for the coordination problem is the following.
 A seller keeps his schedule open by rejecting low-value jobs to increase
 his individual chances of getting high-value jobs.
 As a result, in equilibrium, sellers spend a lot of time waiting for the
 high-value jobs.
 Collectively, this behavior is suboptimal because all profitable jobs have
 to be completed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Interestingly, that unlike in the price competition, that benefits buyers
 and improves market efficiency, seller coordination problem in this setting
 results in inefficient outcome with both lower buyer and seller surplus.
 This is a market failure.
 I attribute the source of the failure to the 
\emph on
crowding externality 
\emph default
generated by sellers.
 By rejecting a job, a seller remains available on the marketplace and attracts
 a fraction of subsequent buyers, who otherwise would go the other sellers.
 As a result, the other sellers face fewer profitable jobs and obtain lower
 profits.
 The key necessary conditions for the crowding externality to arise is the
 dynamic nature of matching and dispersed seller capacities.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fundamental reason behind the coordination failure is that collectively,
 the sellers are not capacity constrained (in time) while individually,
 the sellers 
\emph on
are
\emph default
 capacity constrained.
 When an individual seller accepts a job, he is off the market for time
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 and cannot accept new jobs.
 He is afraid to miss valuable future jobs and therefore rejects low-value
 jobs.
 However, there are always 
\bar under
some
\bar default
 available workers in the market, and it is feasible to accept all profitable
 jobs.
 Mathematically, the distinction between individual and collective capacity
 constraints is captured by having a continuum of sellers, so that while
 buyer traffic to each individual seller is stochastic, the aggregate buyer
 traffic is deterministic.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we know that the full disclosure outcome is Pareto dominated by some
 strategy profile 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\sigma}$
\end_inset

.
 A natural question is whether there is an information disclosure policy
 that induces 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\sigma}$
\end_inset

? In the next section we give the affirmative answer to this question in
 the case of identical workers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Optimal information disclosure with identical sellers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I start by considering the case of identical sellers, i.e.
 singleton 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

.
 The next proposition establishes that any Pareto optimal outcome (in profit-sur
plus space) is implementable by a disclosure policy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "prop:Pareto-frontier"

\end_inset

Suppose the sellers are identical.
 Then for any Pareto optimal outcome 
\begin_inset Formula $(V,CS)$
\end_inset

 there is a disclosure policy that implements it.
 Furthermore, an optimal disclosure policy has binary structure.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The proof relies on the Revelation principle.
 Since there is one seller type and two actions, it is sufficient to consider
 only disclosure policies that send two signals, where a signal is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

action recommendation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 With such a binary signaling structure, the seller dynamic optimization
 problem reduces to the static optimization problem.
 Indeed, with only one type of acceptable jobs, there is no option value
 of rejecting a profitable jobs.
 All profitable jobs are the same! Since a Pareto optimal outcome is feasible
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $V\geq0$
\end_inset

, sellers have incentives to follow the platform's recommendations.
 For the details of the proof, see the Appendix.

 The Individual choice effect gives a motive to the platform to release

 to conceal information.
 The Delaying and the Option Value effects are the consequences of the general
 principle that more information imposes more constraints on the designer

When workers are identical, achieving efficiency requires coarse information

 win over the Individual Choice effect.
 Denote the efficient disclosure policy by

 Note that

 There are two sources of inefficiency under full disclosure.
 Jobs 
\begin_inset Formula $\{x\colon-u(x)\leq\pi(x)\leq0\}$

 decisions on buyers.
 This is the Delaying effect.
 Jobs

How does the efficient disclosure policy

 that

 does not depend on the intensity of buyer traffic 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$

 (optimal disclosure for other

\begin_layout Standard
Typically, the platform observes seller preferences imperfectly, and there
 is seller preference component that is known only to the seller (skill
 level, willingness to do long rides, etc).
 If there is privately known match value held by sellers, the intermediary’s
 ability to influence the market outcome using information design  is limited.
 Depending on the distribution of seller types, there may or may not exist
 a coarse disclosure policy that improves acceptance rates.
 In this section I provide sufficient conditions for this.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To see the intuition behind additional problems the platform faces when
 sellers have private information, imagine two types of sellers: professionals
 and amateurs.
 Professionals can profitably complete a larger set of jobs than amateurs.
 When the platform designs the disclosure policy, it should take into considerat
ion different effects the disclosure policy will have on the two groups
 of sellers.
 Amateurs can only do a small subset of jobs, and so they require more informati
on to be able to profitable complete any jobs.
 If insufficient information is provided, they reject all jobs because they
 cannot tell apart profitable jobs from the unprofitable jobs.
 On the other hand, more disclosure makes the professionals more picky and
 decreases their acceptance rate.
 The resolution of this tradeoff depends on the relative sizes of amateur
 and professional populations.
 If there are more professionals than amateurs, then less disclosure increases
 the total acceptance rates even though amateurs stop working.
 If there are more amateurs, coarse disclosure policy decreases the total
 acceptance rate.
 In the rest of this section we study this problem for the general continuous
 distribution of seller types.

 This goal motivates the choice of the linear payoff environment.

 If buyer traffic

 In one-shot matching setting, coarsening information decreases the acceptance

 sellers.
 With uniform distribution of seller types, these two effects cancel out
 and the total number of matches is unchanged (

 However, when sellers optimize dynamically, less information also decreases
 their option value of rejection and increases the acceptance rate.
 Therefore, no disclosure becomes optimal with dynamic matching.

In this result, we shut down the Option Value effect of information disclosure

 In the equilibrium, the pdf of available seller types is decreasing because
 high seller types have higher acceptance rates.
 By the result from the static matching (

 From

 we know that the full disclosure outcome is suboptimal.
 In the case of identical sellers, it was possible to implement any point
 on the Pareto frontier by information disclosure (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "prop:Pareto-frontier"

), and therefore coarsening was necessary for optimality.
 In the case of heterogeneous sellers, the Pareto frontier is not implementable
 because sellers have private information.
 Therefore, the

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 is below the Pareto frontier.
 Now, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\tau$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\oy$
\end_inset

 are large enough then the full disclosure outcome is below the implementability
 frontier, and efficiency requires some coarsening.
 The optimal disclosures in this case are described in

 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\tau$

 outcome.
 That is, the full disclosure is optimal for welfare maximization, match-rate
 maximization or joint profits maximization.

In this subsection I sketch the proof of

 The main idea behind the proof is to represent information disclosure 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 as a bounded convex function 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda(\cdot)$
\end_inset

, and then use the calculus of variations to find the optimal 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$

\begin_layout Standard
The result is shown in e.g.

 The proof uses the fact that distribution of

\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 The power of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 is that it shows that any disclosure policy can be represented as some
 non-negative, non-decreasing and convex function from

\end_inset

 See

 for illustration.
 We are going to use notation 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

 for a typical element of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, the optimization of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{J}$
\end_inset

 with respecto to 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\in\Delta(S)$
\end_inset

 is equivalent to the optimization with respecto to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda\in\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset

 The latter allows me to use the calcuslus of variations to find the optimality

A way to see the contribution of

 The seller's problem becomes static when 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=0$
\end_inset

 A variation of the following result has been shown in

 Then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\delta M}{\delta\Lambda}\propto-g'(y).\label{eq:dM/dW-static}

If 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 is concave, then full disclosure is optimal.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

The result easily follows from 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Standard
When matching is dynamic, the original formula 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "eq:dM/dW-static"

\end_inset

 has to be adjusted for the dynamic effects, as shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "eq:dM/dW"

\end_inset

.
 I now explain the additional dynamic effects in more detail.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To better understand the additional effects, consider uniform distribution
 of seller types, 
\begin_inset Formula $G=U[0,1]$
\end_inset

.
 Under uniform distribution in the static case, the disclosure policy does
 not matter: 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\delta M}{\delta\Lambda}=0$
\end_inset

 for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

.
 In my model, however, we have that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\delta M}{\delta\Lambda}\propto-(\nu^{2}(y)-\nu(y))'.
\]

\end_inset

There are two additional forces that the intermediary has to consider when
 the matching problem becomes dynamic: 
\emph on
availability effect 
\emph default
and
\emph on
 patience effect
\emph default
.
 The availability effect arises because in equilibrium, high types are less
 available than low types.
 This makes the effective distribution of sellers concave, and creates a
 motive for the intermediary to use finer disclosure policy.
 Term 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu^{2}(y)$
\end_inset

 in the expression above is responsible for the availability effect.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The patience effect arises because sellers do not act myopically and may
 reject jobs due to temporal optimization.
 High types have greater option value of rejecting a job, and so all held
 equal they are more picky than low types.
 Note that this effect is dynamic and is distinct from the pure static effect
 of high types having higher match value.
 Relatively higher pickiness of high types creates a motive for the intermediary
 to coarsen disclosure for high types.
 Term 
\begin_inset Formula $-\nu(y)$
\end_inset

 in the expression above is responsible for the patience effect.

 Main results of this section are: 1) there is a continuum of competitive

 and price 
\begin_inset Formula $p$

 Additionally, buyer

Price set by the intermediary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In this section we study a situation when the platform controls the price
 on the platform (e.g.
 in case of Uber and Instacart).
 This brings us closer to the literature on pricing in two-sided markets
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "RT06,Wey10"

).
 However, unlike these papers, we are more specific about where the network
 effect is coming from and also sellers have a decision margin not related
 to participation – acceptance rate.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Match-maximizing platform.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
From the previous section we know that whatever price a Walrasian auctioneer
 picks, it can be sustained in a competitive equilibrium.
 We thus pose a question: if the platform can set the price, what price
 and disclosure policy should it use to maximize the number of matches?
 The platform solves 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\max_{\lambda,p}\alpha\beta(\alpha,p),
\]

\end_inset

subject to {
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We know from 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "prop:Pareto-frontier"

\end_inset

 the form of the optimal disclosure policy for given price.
 How should the price be set? To induce more demand, the platform would
 like to choose lower price.
 But the lower the price, the lower seller utilization rate can be implemented.
 The next result quantifies this tradeoff.

Revenue-maximizing platform.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When the platform in the stage of growth, it wants to be bigger.
 Later on, the platform turn to monetization.
 We are interested in answering the following question: How does the platform
 policies change when it is profit-maximizing? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
To get a cut from sellers revenue, the platform uses two prices: price 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 for buyers and wage 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 for sellers.
 Additionally, it has disclosure policy as an instrument.
 The platform's objective is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
 &  & \max_{\lambda,p,w}\beta(\alpha,p)\alpha(p-w)\\
 & \mbox{s.t.} & AC(\alpha)\leq w
\end{eqnarray*}

 The profit-maximizing disclosure policy has the form

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The next results states how the marketplace variables change after the platform
 transitions from the match-maximizing mode to the revenue-maximizing mode.
 Imagine the platform starts with match-maximizing as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "prop:opt-price-and-conflation-max-m"

\end_inset

.
 It makes zero revenue there because it takes zero fee on transactions.
 There are two ways to increase the intermediary's revenue.
 One is increase buy price, the other one is to decrease the wage.
 However, decreasing 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 decreases acceptance rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

, so it might be profitable to increase both 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

.
 Depending on the properties of the demand, the platform may find it optimal
 either to increase both 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

, or decrease both 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

, or increase 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and decrease 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

.
 The next result provides sufficient conditions for when the acceptance
 rate is higher (lower) under profit-maximization than under match-maximization.

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\tau\beta(y,\alpha(y),p_{y},x(y)/x)\alpha(y)+x(y)=g(y).\label{eq:Ax=g}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Denote the left-hand side of the equation by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\bx=(x(y))_{y\in Y}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{A}$
\end_inset

 is a correspondence that maps 
\begin_inset Formula $\bx$
\end_inset

 into 
\begin_inset Formula $\R^{dimY}$
\end_inset

.
 First we show that the solution to 
\begin_inset Formula $\bA(\bx)=\mathbf{g}$
\end_inset

 exists, then we show that it is unique.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
For existence, consider a mapping 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 defined as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{i}(\bx)=g_{i}-\tau\beta(y_{i},\alpha(y_{i}),p_{y_{i}},x(y_{i})/x)\alpha(y_{i}).
\]

\end_inset

Define 
\begin_inset Formula $X=\{(x_{1},...x_{\dim Y})\colon0\leq x_{i}\leq g_{i}\}$
\end_inset

.
 We will show that mapping 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 satisfies the conditions of Brouwer's fixed point theorem.
 First, 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 maps 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 to itself.
 Indeed, 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{i}(\bx)\leq g_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 But also
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{i}(\bx)\geq g_{i}-\tau\beta(y_{i},1,p_{y_{i}},1)>0.
\]

\end_inset

The first inequality uses 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "assu:Frictional-consumer-search"

\end_inset

 and demand monotonicity in 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

.
 The second inequality uses 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "assu:no-excess-demand"

\end_inset

.
 Second, 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 is compact.
 Finally, 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is continuous.
 Therefore, Brouwer's theorem ensures the existence of a fixed point, which
 is a solution to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "eq:Ax=g"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
In the rest of the proof we prove uniqueness.
 We will show that the principal minors of Jacobian matrix of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bA$
\end_inset

 are non-negative everywhere.
 Then by Gale-Nikaido (1965), the mapping is one-to-one and hence 
\begin_inset Formula $\bA(\bx)=\mathbf{g}$
\end_inset

 has a unique solution.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
J=\begin{bmatrix}\frac{\partial A_{1}}{\partial x_{1}} & \frac{\partial A_{1}}{\partial x_{2}} & ...\\
\frac{\partial A_{2}}{\partial x_{1}} & \frac{\partial A_{2}}{\partial x_{2}}\\
\vdots &  & \ddots
\end{bmatrix},
\]

\end_inset

where we use a simplified notation 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}:=x(y_{1})$
\end_inset

.
 Use notation 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}=x_{1}/x$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{\partial A_{1}}{\partial x_{1}} & = & \tau\frac{d\beta(y_{1},\alpha(y_{1}),p_{y_{1}},x(y_{1})/x)\alpha(y_{1})}{d\nu_{1}}\frac{d(x(y_{1})/x)}{dx_{1}}+1=\\
 & = & \tau\frac{d\beta(y_{1},\alpha(y_{1}),p_{y_{1}},x(y_{1})/x)\alpha(y_{1})}{d\nu_{1}}\frac{x-x_{1}}{x^{2}}+1.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Denote for brevity 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{1}=\frac{d\beta(y_{1},\alpha(y_{1}),p_{y_{1}},x(y_{1})/x)\alpha(y_{1})}{d\nu_{1}}$
\end_inset

.
 Then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial A_{1}}{\partial x_{1}}=\frac{\tau}{x}\beta_{1}(1-\nu_{1})+1.
\]

\end_inset

Similary find
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial A_{1}}{\partial x_{2}}=-\frac{\tau}{x}\beta_{1}\nu_{1}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
We need to show that all principle minors of matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 are non-negative.
 Without loss of generality, consider the leading principal minor of size
 
\begin_inset Formula $K=1,...,\dim Y$
\end_inset

, denote it by 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{K}$
\end_inset

.
 It can be rewritten as follows
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
J_{K}=\begin{bmatrix}1+\frac{\tau}{x}\beta_{1} & ... & 0\\
\vdots & \ddots\\
0 &  & 1+\frac{\tau}{x}\beta_{K}
\end{bmatrix}+\frac{\tau}{x}\begin{bmatrix}-\beta_{1}\nu_{1}\\
\vdots\\
-\beta_{2}\nu_{2}
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}1 & 1 & 1\end{bmatrix}.
\]

\end_inset

Now I will use the following formula for the determinants:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\det(X+AB)=\det X\det(I+BX^{-1}A).
\]

\end_inset

In case of matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{K}$
\end_inset

, we obtain:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\det J_{K}=\det\begin{bmatrix}1+\frac{\tau}{x}\beta_{1} & ... & 0\\
\vdots & \ddots\\
0 &  & 1+\frac{\tau}{x}\beta_{K}
\end{bmatrix}\det(1+\begin{bmatrix}1 & 1 & 1\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}1+\frac{\tau}{x}\beta_{1} & ... & 0\\
\vdots & \ddots\\
0 &  & 1+\frac{\tau}{x}\beta_{K}
\end{bmatrix}^{-1}\frac{\tau}{x}\begin{bmatrix}-\beta_{1}\nu_{1}\\
\vdots\\
-\beta_{2}\nu_{2}
\end{bmatrix}).
\]

\end_inset

We need to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\det J_{K}\geq0$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\bx$
\end_inset

.
 It is sufficient to the second determinant on the right hand side of the
 formula above.
 We need to show
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
1+\frac{\tau}{x}\sum_{i=1}^{K}\frac{-\beta_{i}\nu_{i}}{1+\frac{\tau}{x}\beta_{i}}\geq0.
\]

\end_inset

First observe that 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\beta_{i}\tau/x}{\beta_{i}\tau/x+1}\leq1$
\end_inset

, and then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
1+\frac{\tau}{x}\sum_{i=1}^{K}\frac{-\beta_{i}\nu_{i}}{1+\frac{\tau}{x}\beta_{i}}\geq1-\sum_{i=1}^{K}\nu_{i}\geq0,
\]

\end_inset

because 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=1}^{\dim Y}\nu_{i}=1$
\end_inset

.
 This proves that all principal minors of 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 are non-negative, and by Gale-Nikaido (1965), 
\begin_inset Formula $\bA(\bx)=\mathbf{g}$
\end_inset

 has a unique solutions.

Take any Pareto optimal pair 
\begin_inset Formula $O=(V,CS)$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

 is feasible, there is seller strategy profile 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 that induces 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

.
 Since there is one seller type and two actions, it is sufficient to consider
 only the binary signaling structures (Revelation principle).
 A binary signaling structure has two signals, where a signal is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

action recommendation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{a}$
\end_inset

 be the recommendation to accept, and 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{r}$
\end_inset

 be the recommendation to reject.
 Denote this signaling structure by 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\lambda}$
\end_inset

.
 We need to check the incentive constraints, that is, to make sure that
 the sellers would follow the recommendations of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\lambda}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
From 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:pi(c)"

\end_inset

 we have that 
\begin_inset Formula $v(s_{a})=\pi(s_{a})-\tau V$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $v(s_{r})=0$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $V=\beta_{A}(\pi(s_{a})-\tau V)\hat{\lambda}(s_{a})$
\end_inset

.
 The incentive constraints require that 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(s_{a})\geq\tau V$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(s_{r})\leq0$
\end_inset

.
 For the former,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tau V=\frac{\tau\beta_{A}\hat{\lambda}(s_{a})}{1+\tau\beta_{A}\hat{\lambda}(s_{a})}\pi(s_{a})<\pi(s_{a}).
\]

\end_inset

For the latter, recall that 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

 is Pareto optimal, hence 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 accepts all profitable jobs.
 This implies that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\pi(s_{r})\leq0<\tau V.

Step 1.
 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{A}$
\end_inset

 are positively related.
 Indeed, when the mass of available sellers is 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

, the flow of matches is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
M=\frac{1-X}{\tau}.
\]

\end_inset

The buyer arrival rate on available sellers is 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{A}=\beta/X$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
M=\frac{1-\beta/\beta_{A}}{\tau}.
\]

\end_inset

We are interested in the sign of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta M/\delta\Lambda$
\end_inset

, therefore we will find 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\beta_{A}/\delta\Lambda$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Step 2.
 The equilibrium values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha(y)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{A}$
\end_inset

 are found from the system of equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "eq:V-zhat-Lambda"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "eq:beta_A"

\end_inset

, which we reproduce here:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
y-\hat{z}(y) & =\tau\beta_{A}\Lambda(\hat{m}(y)),\quad\forall y\in Y;\label{eq:20}\\
\int\frac{dG(y)}{\tau\alpha(y)+1/\beta_{A}} & =\beta.\label{eq:21}
\end{align}

\end_inset

Take the differential of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "eq:21"

\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
-\int\frac{dG(y)\left(\tau\delta\alpha(y)-\delta\beta_{A}/\beta_{A}^{2}\right)}{\left(\tau\alpha(y)+1/\beta_{A}\right)^{2}}=0.\nonumber \\
\frac{\delta\beta_{A}}{\beta_{A}^{2}}\int\frac{dG(y)}{\left(\tau\alpha(y)+1/\beta_{A}\right)^{2}}-\tau\int\frac{\delta\alpha(y)dG(y)}{\left(\tau\alpha(y)+1/\beta_{A}\right)^{2}}=0.\nonumber \\
\delta\beta_{A}=\frac{\tau\int\frac{\delta\alpha(y)dG(y)}{\left(\tau\alpha(y)+1/\beta_{A}\right)^{2}}}{\frac{1}{\beta_{A}^{2}}\int\frac{dG(y)}{\left(\tau\alpha(y)+1/\beta_{A}\right)^{2}}}.\label{eq:delta-betaA}
\end{gather}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Now use the fact that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\alpha(y)=\Lambda'(\hat{m}(y)+)\label{eq:alpha=W'}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

to find the differential
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta\alpha(y)=\delta\Lambda'(\hat{m}(y))+\Lambda''(\hat{m}(y))\delta\hat{m}(y).\label{eq:delta-alpha}

-\delta\hat{m}(y)(1+\tau\beta_{A}\alpha(y))=\tau\delta\beta_{A}\Lambda(\hat{m}(y))+\tau\beta_{A}\delta\Lambda(\hat{m}(y)).\label{eq:delta-mhat}
\end{gather}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Plug in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 into 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 and then into 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "eq:delta-betaA"

\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{multline*}
\frac{\delta\beta_{A}}{\beta_{A}^{2}}\int\frac{dG(y)}{\left(\tau\alpha(y)+1/\beta_{A}\right)^{2}}=\tau\int\frac{\delta\alpha(y)dG(y)}{\left(\tau\alpha(y)+1/\beta_{A}\right)^{2}}=\\
=\tau\int\frac{\left(\delta\Lambda'(\hat{m}(y))+\Lambda''(\hat{m}(y))\delta\hat{m}(y)\right)dG(y)}{\left(\tau\alpha(y)+1/\beta_{A}\right)^{2}}=\\
=\tau\int\frac{\left(\delta\Lambda'(\hat{m}(y))\right)dG(y)}{\left(\tau\alpha(y)+1/\beta_{A}\right)^{2}}-\tau\int\frac{\Lambda''(\hat{m}(y))\left(\tau\delta\beta_{A}\Lambda(\hat{m}(y))+\tau\beta_{A}\delta\Lambda(\hat{m}(y))\right)dG(y)}{\left(\tau\alpha(y)+1/\beta_{A}\right)^{3}\beta_{A}}
\end{multline*}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{multline*}
\delta\beta_{A}\left[\int\frac{dG(y)}{\left(\tau\alpha(y)\beta_{A}+1\right)^{2}}+\tau^{2}\int\frac{\Lambda''(\hat{m}(y))\beta_{A}^{2}\Lambda(\hat{m}(y))dG(y)}{\left(\tau\alpha(y)\beta_{A}+1\right)^{3}}\right]=\\
=\tau\int\frac{\delta\Lambda'(\hat{m}(y))dG(y)}{\left(\tau\alpha(y)+1/\beta_{A}\right)^{2}}-\tau^{2}\int\frac{\Lambda''(\hat{m}(y))\delta\Lambda(\hat{m}(y))dG(y)}{\left(\tau\alpha(y)+1/\beta_{A}\right)^{3}}
\end{multline*}

\end_inset

We have both 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\Lambda$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(\delta\Lambda)'$
\end_inset

 on the right hand side of the expression above, and we need to have only
 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\Lambda$
\end_inset

 .
 To get it, we will use integration by parts.
 Consider separately the first term in the previous line:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather*}
Z_{1}:=\tau\int\frac{\delta\Lambda'(\hat{m}(y))dG(y)}{\left(\tau\alpha(y)+1/\beta_{A}\right)^{2}}=\tau\beta_{A}^{2}\int\frac{\left(\delta\Lambda(\hat{m}(y))\right)'g(y)dy}{\left(\tau\alpha(y)\beta_{A}+1\right)^{2}}=\tau\beta_{A}^{2}\int\frac{g(y)d\left(\delta\Lambda(\hat{m}(y))\right)}{\left(\tau\alpha(y)\beta_{A}+1\right)^{2}}=\\
=\tau\beta_{A}^{2}\frac{g(y)\delta\Lambda(\hat{m}(y))}{\left(\tau\alpha(y)\beta_{A}+1\right)^{2}}|_{\underline{y}}^{\overline{y}}-\tau\beta_{A}^{2}\int\delta\Lambda(\hat{m}(y))d\left(\frac{g(y)}{\left(\tau\alpha(y)\beta_{A}+1\right)^{2}}\right)=\\
=-\tau\beta_{A}^{2}\int\delta\Lambda(\hat{m}(y))d\left(\frac{g(y)}{\left(\tau\alpha(y)\beta_{A}+1\right)^{2}}\right)=\\
=-\tau\beta_{A}^{2}\int\delta\Lambda(\hat{m}(y))\frac{g'(y)\left(\tau\alpha(y)\beta_{A}+1\right)^{2}-2g(y)\left(\tau\alpha(y)\beta_{A}+1\right)\tau\beta_{A}\alpha'(y)}{\left(\tau\alpha(y)\beta_{A}+1\right)^{4}}dy=\\
=\tau\beta_{A}^{2}\int\delta\Lambda(\hat{m}(y))\left[-\frac{g'(y)}{\left(\tau\alpha(y)\beta_{A}+1\right)^{2}}+\frac{2g(y)\tau\beta_{A}\alpha'(y)}{\left(\tau\alpha(y)\beta_{A}+1\right)^{3}}\right]dy
\end{gather*}

\end_inset

Using 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "eq:alpha=W'"

\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\alpha'(y)=\Lambda''(\hat{m}(y))\hat{m}'(y).
\]

\end_inset

Differentiate 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "eq:20"

\end_inset

 wrt 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
1-\hat{m}'(y) & =\tau\beta_{A}\alpha(y)\hat{m}'(y)\\
\hat{m}'(y) & =\frac{1}{1+\tau\beta_{A}\alpha(y)}.
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
For brevity, adopt the notation 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\nu(y):=\frac{1}{1+\tau\beta_{A}\alpha(y)}.
\]

\end_inset

The notation is not coincidental, 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu(y)$
\end_inset

 is equal to the fraction of type-
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 sellers who are available in equilibrium.
 Return to compute
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Z_{1}=\tau\beta_{A}^{2}\int\delta\Lambda(\hat{m}(y))\left[-g'(y)\nu(y)^{2}+\nu(y)^{3}2g(y)\tau\beta_{A}\Lambda''\nu\right]dy.
\]

\end_inset

Now we finish computing the differential 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\beta_{A}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{multline*}
\frac{\delta\beta_{A}}{\beta_{A}^{2}}\int\frac{dG(y)}{\left(\tau\alpha(y)+1/\beta_{A}\right)^{2}}=\\
=\tau\beta_{A}^{2}\int\delta\Lambda(\hat{m}(y))\left[-g'(y)\nu(y)^{2}+\nu(y)^{3}2g(y)\tau\beta_{A}\Lambda''\nu\right]dy-\tau^{2}\int\Lambda''(\hat{m}(y))\delta\Lambda(\hat{m}(y))\nu^{3}\beta_{A}^{3}dG(y)=\\
=\tau\int\delta\Lambda(\hat{m}(y))\left[-g'(y)\nu(y)^{2}\beta_{A}^{2}+\nu(y)^{4}2g(y)\tau\beta_{A}\Lambda''\beta_{A}^{2}-\tau\Lambda''(\hat{m}(y))\nu^{3}g(y)\beta_{A}^{3}\right]dy.
\end{multline*}

\end_inset

We are interested in the expression in the square brackets in the formula
 above.
 Therefore, for some 
\begin_inset Formula $K>0$
\end_inset

 that is constant in 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 we have: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\frac{\delta\beta_{A}}{\delta\Lambda} & =K\left(-g'(y)\nu(y)^{2}+\nu(y)^{4}2g(y)\tau\beta_{A}\Lambda''-\tau\Lambda''(\hat{m}(y))\nu^{3}g(y)\beta_{A}\right)=\\
 & =K\nu(y)^{2}\left(-g'(y)+g(y)\nu(y)\tau\beta_{A}\Lambda''(\hat{m}(y))(2\nu(y)-1)\right).
\end{align*}

Allow for the case when

 If

, then sellers get overwhelmed by the buyer requests and can't respond to
 all of them to the extent that they can't even reject them.
 To cover this situation we assume that if there are no available sellers
 to reject a pending buyer request, the platform rejects it automatically.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since some requests can be rejected by the platform, the acceptance rate
 as perceived by buyers does not coincide with the acceptance rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 generated by sellers.
 Denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha^{e}$
\end_inset

 the effective acceptance rate that 
\bar under
buyers
\bar default
 face.
 Let at some moment of time there is 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in[0,1]$
\end_inset

 mass of available sellers, and let buyers arrive to the platform at rate
 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
 Then within the next time interval 
\begin_inset Formula $dt$

, there are 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta dt$
\end_inset

 new request, and 
\begin_inset Formula $x+\left(\frac{1-x}{\tau}dt\right)$
\end_inset

 available sellers.
 What is 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha^{e}$
\end_inset

 when sellers use acceptance rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

? Consider three cases.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $x>0$
\end_inset

.
 There is plenty of available sellers, 
\begin_inset Formula $x+\left(\frac{1-x}{\tau}dt\right)>\beta dt$
\end_inset

.
 Fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 of buyers are accepted, therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha^{e}=\alpha$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\beta<\frac{1}{\tau}$
\end_inset

.
 There are few sellers that just became available but in sufficient number
 to process all buyers.
 In the same fashion as in case 1, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha^{e}=\alpha$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

 but 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\beta\geq\frac{1}{\tau}$
\end_inset

.
 Not sufficient sellers to process all buyers, some buyers are rejected
 by the platform.
 The number of accepted jobs is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{\tau}dt$
\end_inset

.
 The acceptance rate is therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha^{e}=\frac{1/\tau}{\beta}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{A}=+\infty$

 reflects the fact that when the demand is overwhelming, buyers line up
 for sellers so sellers start a new job immediately after they finish the

 The No Excess Demand assumption makes sure that this never happens, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\beta(\alpha)\tau<1$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\in[0,1]$
