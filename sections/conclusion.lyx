This paper studies the role of information intermediation in matching markets
 and shows that strategic information disclosure can be an effective tool
 for balancing the tradeoff between match quality and match rate.
 When the two sides of the market are not symmetric in their preferences
 for match quality and match rate, the more patient and selective side of
 the market (sellers in my setting) tends to cream-skim.
 As a platform's policy, strategic limiting of information can be used to

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In this paper, I formally studied how inforamtion disclosure in matching
 markets affects the tradeoff between match quality and match rate.
 Matching platforms spend significant resources eliciting match-relevant
 information from the users.
 The platform uses these data to match users more efficiently, either by
 developing a centralized assignment mechanism or by enabling effective
 search.
 Making detailed use information observable to other users ensures the most
 valuable matches are formed.
 However, increased observability can backfire.
 The search imposes cross-side and same-side externalities, which if unchecked,
 decrease the match rate and hamper the performance of the marketplace.
 The platform's goal is to make sure that both sides of the market receive
 high benefits from participation.
 First, because users must derive value on the platform comopared to transacting
 outside of the platform.
 Second, platform growth depends on the users' positive experiences.
 To offset the search externalities, the platform need to take more control
 over the matching process.

\begin_layout Standard
This paper provides a case for a platform's control over the matching process
 through information design.
 Strategic information disclosure is less intrusive than direct control
 and often more accessible than sophisticated pricing schemes.
 For example, one way to insure that sellers internalize the costs of rejection
 imposed on buyers is to charge sellers a fee for every rejection.
 However, such a policy makes transactions too information-sensitive, and
 makes it unsafe for sellers to participate on the platform.

 shows that if drivers have full information about passenger rides and full
 discretion over accepting, they cream-skim: acceptance rates are low, and
 the demand-supply fit is suboptimal.
 The platform's policy of hiding passenger destination from drivers is used
 to nudge drivers to accept more rides and avoid the cream-skimming on destinati
on.

Uber drivers can use the destination filter twice a day.
 If used, the platform filters passenger requests and offers only those
 that are aligned with the driver's preferred destination.

 This paper shows that partial coarsening would be more efficient.
 For example, my results show that the drivers with 
\change_deleted -484307115 1479832136
higher
\change_inserted -484307115 1479832158

 outside option (low type sellers) require finer disclosure to stay profitable
 on the platform while drivers with 
\change_deleted -484307115 1479832144
low
\change_inserted -484307115 1479832146
worse
\change_unchanged
 outside option (high type sellers) can be squeezed
\change_inserted -484307115 1479830411
 out
\change_unchanged
.
 In such situation, the following partial coarsening can work better.
 The destination of a passenger is discretized into three categories, close,
 medium-range, and far, where the medium-range is wide enough to include
 most rides.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
UberX currently uses a simple pricing rule combined with information disclosure
 coarsening and other requirements for drivers, such as minimal acceptance
 rates.
 A natural question is why Uber does not adopt a flexible pricing scheme
 that would condition price on ride destination.
 There are several reasons for this.
 First, consumers appreciate transparent and simple pricing, both because
 it is easier to assess the cost of a ride before looking it up in the app
 and because complex pricing can feel like price gauging.
 Second, flexible pricing that conditions on destination is a non-trivial
 development task that requires significant development resources.

UberPool already conditions prices on many variables, and as far as I am
 aware from private conversations, Uber is testing similarly flexible pricing
 scheme on its UberX product.
 Currently, the upfront UberX price is calculated using the expected time
 and distance of the trip and local traffic, as well as how many riders
 and nearby drivers have their Uber app open at that moment.

 Third, and relatedly, it is not feasible to condition on every possible
 relevant variable in the transportation market.
 There is some complexity threshold for the designer beyond which increasing
 the price complexity is not justified on practicality grounds.

 the destination variable should be discretized to be practically useful
 for pricing.
 Finally, Uber has sufficient data on its users to introduce personalized
 pricing for each passenger independent of just individual destination.
 Because of a risk of price-discrimination litigation, personalized pricing
 has not been implemented.

 shows that hosts cream-skim if they have detailed information about guests.
 This results in low acceptance rates that fail to satisfy guest demand
 for convenient booking service, thereby compromising marketplace performance.
 The Instant Book feature in its current version acts as an information
 coarsening policy, incentivizing hosts to accept more guest requests.
 As a first order effect, guests benefit because booking is fast.
 
\change_inserted -484307115 1479833773

 also benefit, because better user experience attracts more guests to the

 As a result, total welfare increases, in addition to platform participation.

Optimal guest segmentation in the Instant Book feature should remain coarse.
 Too fine segmentation of guests brings back the problem of cream-skimming.
 The problem of optimal guest segments is equivalent to the problem of the
 optimal information disclosure and can be analyzed within the framework
 of this paper.
 Specifically, the optimal guest segmentation balances host demand for transpare
ncy and guest demand for convenience.
 Furthermore, markets with a higher buyer-to-seller ratio require coarser
 guest segmentation than the markets with a low buyer-to-seller ratio.

For TaskRabbit and other temp agencies, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 shows that if service providers understand well their payoffs from the
 offered tasks, they cream-skim.
 A service provider may prefer to reject the tasks that are too far in terms
 of traveling distance, inconvenient in timing, or uninteresting.
 This cream-skimming yields low labor force utilization, which is inefficient
 from the platform's perspective.
 Buyers prefer to be able to hire workers on demand.
 TaskRabbit's solution was to redesign the matching system so that service
 providers commit to an hourly rate over a broad category of tasks.

\end_layout

\end_inset

 The benefit of this coarsening is two-fold.
 First, as in the above examples, it nudges the service providers to accept
 more tasks by increasing their expected marginal profit.
 Second, since the platform uses only task type (e.g.
 Home Cleaning) to match clients and workers, the platform need to elicit
 from clients only the type of the requested task.
 This further improves the clients' experience on the platform, because
 answering multiple questions is burdensome for the clients.

This paper has two implications for the platform designers.
 First, it alerts for potentially adverse effects of increased observability.
 If the buyer and seller side of a given market are not symmetric in their
 preferences for match rate and match quality, then revealing rich information
 to the pickier side of the market hampers match rate.
 The side of the market that values high match rate as opposed to high match
 quality suffers.
 This may create the unbalanced market that won't scale up.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted -484307115 1479934245
Second, if a given market is fast-moving and match rate enters into the
 participants utility functions, limiting information can achieve better
 matching efficiency.
 Strategic information withholding may come at various forms.
 One is literal information withholding as the one we observe in the case
 of Uber.
 Another one is creating standards.
