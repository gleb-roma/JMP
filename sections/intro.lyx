 In decentralized matching markets, such as market for lodging, labor market,
 dating market and others, information availability is the key to the well-funct
ioning market.
 Information allows the participants to identify the most valuable options
 and facilitates trade (Akerlof 70,

).
 However, information availability exacerbates the problem of excessive
 screening, which is an important source of market failure in matching markets.
 A distinguishing feature of a matching market relative to a consumer market
 is that buyers not only choose but must also be chosen by sellers (Roth
 08).
 In fast-moving marketplaces seller rejections are consequential.
 As a stark example, on Airbnb,

 hosts (Fradkin 2016).

\end_layout

\end_inset

Optimal information disclosure must balance two opposing forces—letting
 the participants find their preferred matches, and preventing the cream-skimmin
g behavior that leads to slow matching.
 On the one hand, information availability reveals the heterogeneity of
 buyers and allows the sellers to identify those they value the most.
 This increases seller surplus.
 On the other hand, the screening can take long.
 If the sellers' preferences for matches are not aligned with the buyers',
 or if buyers have higher cost of rejection (e.g.
 due to higher time-sensitivity), then meticulous screening hurts buyer
 surplus.
 When little information is available, the sellers settle for less and screen
 faster.
 Information coarsening is thus a welfare-improving intervention.
 It has been recognized in the information economics literature

Overview of the model

In this paper I develop a model of information intermediation in decentralized
 matching markets in order to formalize this information disclosure tradeoffs
 and to characterize the optimal disclosure policy for a class of decentralized
 matching environments.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 sets up the model in which short-lived buyers gradually arrive over time
 and pursue long-lived sellers by proposing jobs.
 Sellers have heterogeneous preferences over jobs and independently decide
 what jobs to accept.
 Sellers have limited capacity: when a seller accepts a job, he becomes
 busy and cannot accept new jobs.
 Buyer and seller preferences over matches are not aligned: jobs unprofitable
 for sellers may be valuable for buyers.
 In contrast to many search-and-matching models that have a coordination
 friction as the main matching friction (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "BSW01,Kir09,AJK14"

\end_inset

), I assume no coordination friction: only available sellers receive buyer
 requests.
 The assumption is motivated by the observation that most digital platforms
 have good technological means of solving the coordination problem.

Design tool: disclosure policy
\end_layout

\end_inset

The platform uses information disclosure policy as a design tool.
 Before the matching process starts running, the platform commits to a disclosur
e policy that governs what buyer information is revealed to sellers each
 time they have to make the acceptance decision.
 The policy is modeled as a signaling game between the platform and heterogeneou
s sellers, built on

 and seller profits.

If sellers are identical, then some information coarsening is always optimal.
 In this case, as shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Identical-sellers"

\end_inset

, the efficient coarsening involves pooling inframarginal profitable jobs
 with marginal unprofitable but efficient jobs.
 This way, sellers' actions get aligned with the platform's objective.
 Higher buyer search costs imply a larger set of efficient matches, and
 so the efficient disclosure exhibits more coarsening.
 However, the sellers may have payoff heterogeneity unobserved by the platform.
 In this case, information coarsening tailored to increase the acceptance
 rate of one seller can overburden another seller and violate his individual
 rationality constraint.
 What coarsening is optimal, if any, is now not obvious, as the optimal
 policy depends on the distribution of seller types and should accommodate
 the diverse reactions to information.

In the linear payoff environment, with vertically differentiated buyers
 and vertically differentiated sellers, the optimal disclosure policy depends
 on the intensity of buyer traffic and the tightness of seller capacity

 Here, seller match payoff is

\begin_inset Formula $y\sim U[0,\overline{y}]$

 and buyer type

\end_inset

, and buyer payoff is constant.
 In this case, as shown in

, the optimal match-maximizing disclosure policy is 
\emph on

 This is in stark contrast with the static case (cf.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

), in which information disclosure does not affect the number of matches.
 When buyer-to-seller ration is high or the seller capacity constraints
 are tighter, the efficient disclosure is also upper-coarsening.
 In a converse case, the full disclosure is efficient.
 For the general distribution of seller types, the optimal disclosure depends
 on whether pdf of seller types is decreasing or increasing and the seller
 utilization rates.

3 competing effects on information disclosure
\end_layout

\end_inset

Disclosure to sellers has three competing effects on welfare, with the optimal
 disclosure determined by what effect is dominant.
 The first is the standard 
\emph on
Individual Choice effect
\emph default
 operating on the seller side of the market.
 From an individual seller’s point of view, more information increases his
 set of attainable payoffs (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bla53"

\end_inset

).
 Holding the other sellers' behavior fixed, he individually benefits from
 more information about buyers.
 The second effect of information disclosure is the 
\emph on
Buyer-side effect
\emph default
.
 More information available to sellers reduces the platform's ability to
 induce sellers to accept buyer-valuable jobs.
 The third effect is the 
\emph on
Seller Option Value effect
\emph default
 which arises only with capacity constrained sellers.
 More information available to sellers increases their ability to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cream-skim
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the stream of jobs and increases the option value of rejection.
 In equilibrium, the Option Value effect leads to a range profitable jobs
 being rejected, which hurts the joint seller surplus.
 The Buyer-side and the Option Value effect are the instances of a general
 principle that revealing more information to sellers imposes more constraints
 on the designer and reduces the set of outcomes he can induce (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "BM16-TE"

\end_inset

).
 Both the Buyer-side and the Option Value effects lead to sellers' excessive
 screening — rejection rates are inefficiently high.
 Therefore, the Buyer-side and the Option Value effects give a motive to
 the platform to coarsen information.
 On the contrary, the Individual Choice effect gives a motive to disclose
 information.

coordination problem.
\end_layout

\end_inset

Negative effects of disclosure on sellers (the Option Value effect) is a
 form of seller coordination failure.
 In a marketplace where the sellers act independently, each seller keeps
 his schedule open by rejecting low-value jobs to increase his individual
 chances of getting high-value jobs.
 As a result, sellers spend a lot of time waiting for the high-value jobs.
 Collectively, this behavior is suboptimal because all profitable jobs have
 to be completed.
 The source of the coordination failure is what I call the 
\emph on
cream-skimming externality
\emph default
: By rejecting a job, a seller remains available on the marketplace and
 attracts a fraction of subsequent buyers, who otherwise would go the other
 sellers.
 As a result, the other sellers face fewer profitable jobs and obtain lower
 profits.

The contribution of the present paper is two-fold.
 First, the paper explains the role of information intermediation in decentraliz
ed matching markets.
 It shows that strategic information disclosure can be an effective tool
 to balance the seller's demand for more transparency and buyer's demand
 for less hassle and more speed.
 Simultaneously, it can alleviate the seller coordination failure due to
 cream-skimming externality.

 by extending the signaling game with heterogeneous audience to the case
 with endogenously available and dynamically optimizing receivers.
 In this case, the design of information disclosure is a non-trivial problem.
 Information disclosure policy determines not only the stage payoff of a
 receiver but also the distribution of future potential payoffs.
 As a result, a patient receiver's decision to accept depends not only on
 the posterior mean of the state but also on the entire signaling structure.
 This makes the concavification approach of

New platforms, such as Airbnb and Upwork, were created with the aspiration
 of bringing to the market the idle capacities possessed by dispersed owners.
 These platforms are matching marketplaces in the sense that both buyer
 and worker preferences are potentially highly heterogenous (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "DELS14,Fradkin2014,CFwp,Horton2015"

\end_inset

).
 Hence a platform's goal is to facilitate search and transactions between
 buyers and workers.
 In markets with pronounced heterogeneity, the information provision is
 the key because it improves matching efficiency (e.g.

).
 Yet information availability also gives service providers more control
 over the matching process, grants them more market power that may lead
 to inferior market outcomes.
 This creates a tradeoff between matching efficiency and rent-seeking.
 The precise characterization and various consequences of this tradeoff
 constitute the theme of the present paper.

I develop a model of a

, and he is free to accept or reject buyer requests.
 Coarse segmentation of buyer tasks degrades matching quality for workers
 but also expands the set of equilibrium outcomes, namely it eliminates
 undesirable cream-skimming competition among workers.
 As a result, capacity utilization may increase.
 A combination of these two effects is that generically there exists a coarse
 segmentation of tasks on which the worker profits increase.
 Furthermore, buyers are also better off because higher capacity utilization
 implies shorter delays for buyers.

Dynamic peer-to-peer markets are increasingly relevant: there has been a
 10-fold growth in worker participation in online platforms over the last
 3 years (JP Morgan Chase, 2016).
 Nowadays 19% of the total US adult population has engaged in a sharing
 economy transaction (2015, PWC); Airbnb now lists more rooms than the three
 largest hotel chains combined (Fradkin); Uber has more drivers than taxi
 drivers in US.
 By 2025, online talent platforms could boost global GDP by $2.7 trillion

Many existing platforms have the problem of failed matches.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 of the time.
 Using TaskRabbit data (from June 2010 to May 2014), 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 provides empirical evidence from online labor market UpWork that information
 asymmetry about workers capacity impacts the formation of matches in important
 ways.
 Part of the failed matches occurs due to workers' picking out buyers

 reports that on Airbnb 20% of requests fail due to hosts' cream-skimming.
 
\end_layout

.
 In this paper I study how the platform can use segmentation of buyer tasks
 to improve the utilization rates, where utilization is defined as the fraction
 of the aggregate service providers' capacity being used on average.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Uber addressed the cream-skimming problem by limiting drivers rejection
 rate, and additionally hiding some passenger information from drivers,
 such as ride destination.
 Airbnb is also aware of the problem of worker low acceptance rate, and
 as a solution, introduced Instant Book feature.
 In my framework, a host who adopted Instant Book faces a single segment
 of guests so that he cannot discriminate among them.
 Airbnb is now working on fine tuning the Instant Book feature that would
 allow hosts to use a somewhat finer consumer segments.
 The natural question is how fine these segments should be allowed to be?
 TaskRabbit design defaults workers into accepting incoming tasks, so that
 rejecting tasks is harder because it requires additional actions.
 Moreover, TaskRabbit does not collect task details from customers before
 directing them to the search results.
 Offline markets which possess the same features as peer-to-peer platform
 are housing market, where the real-estate agency is the intermediary.

 The intermediary can increase the worker's acceptance rate by grouping
 tasks right above 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 with the tasks below 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 into one segment.
 The worker infers his expected cost for the segment.
 If the segment contains sufficiently many low-cost tasks, the average cost
 of a task from the segment is low enough, so that the worker is willing
 to accept a random task from the segment.
 Consequently, for any fixed price, the platform can increase the utilization
 rate by coarsening the segments of buyer tasks.
 This simple example, however, does not explain how segmentation influences
 the worker dynamic optimization problem and competition between workers,
 therefore we can't evaluate the equilibrium effect of segmentation and
 can't study implications for the welfare.
 Also in the example I assumed that the platform has complete information
 about the worker's cost, which would be a strong assumption in many application
s.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Coarse segmentation may improve worker profits because information availability
 creates undesirable competition among workers for better buyers.
 Workers choose to keep their schedule open by ignoring low-return jobs
 in order to increase their individual chances of receiving high-return
 jobs.
 I call this behavior
\emph on
 dynamic cream-skimming.

\emph default
 Collectively, this behavior is sub-optimal for workers because all profitable
 jobs should be completed to maximize the joint profits.
 Dynamic cream-skimming results in wasted capacity and lowered worker profits.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Finally, I characterize the optimal segmentation for the intermediary that
 wants to maximize total matches, as a function of worker cost heterogeneity
 and the distribution of workers' productivity.

Minimal example of dynamic cream-skimming.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Suppose there are two identical workers.
 Every time period 
\begin_inset Formula $t=1,2,...$
\end_inset

 one task arrives.
 Each task has profit 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi=1$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi=1/5$
\end_inset

 with equal probabilities.
 The new task is directed to one of the available workers chosen uniformly
 at random.
 If the worker accepts the task, he works on it the next period and does
 not receive new tasks.
 Each worker maximizes the all-time average profit; there is no discounting.
 I will compare two situations: in the first, the workers coordinate to
 maximize the joint profits, in the second, the workers play a blind Nash
 equilibrium.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When the workers coordinate, it is optimal to accept every task.
 The expected per period profit for each worker is then 
\begin_inset Formula $V^{o}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}(1+\frac{1}{5})=.3$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Now consider a Nash equilibrium in which workers do not observe each other
 states and act independently.
 I claim that a pair of strategies where each worker accepts only 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi=1$
\end_inset

 is such an equilibrium.
 Indeed, in this equilibrium, expected per period profit for each worker
 must be 
\begin_inset Formula $V^{*}=1/4$
\end_inset

.
 Suppose a worker receives a task with profit 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi=1$
\end_inset

.
 If he accepts the task, he earns 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 over the course of two periods.
 If he rejects the task, he earns zero today and expects to earn 
\begin_inset Formula $V^{*}$
\end_inset

 tomorrow.
 Therefore the net payoff of accepting 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi=1$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $1-1/4=3/4>0$
\end_inset

, and so tasks 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi=1$
\end_inset

 are accepted.
 Analogously, we find that the net payoff of accepting 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi=1/5$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $1/5-1/4<0$
\end_inset

, and so tasks 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi=1/5$
\end_inset

 are rejected.
 We conclude that the equilibrium outcome is not optimal for the workers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The platform can increase the workers' profits by not revealing the value
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

.
 Then the expected profit of each task is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}(1+\frac{1}{5})=.6>0$
\end_inset

, and so every task is accepted.
 This attains the optimum.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This example shows that in peer-to-peer markets, independent service providers
 engage in self-defeating cream-skimming competition which results in lower
 profits compared to the case when workers coordinate.
 Fundamentally, this happens because jointly the workers are less capacity
 constrained than individually.
 In the example above, it is physically possible for workers to complete
 every buyer task (No Excess Demand assumption in the main model), and so
 collectively, the workers are not capacity constrained.
 Therefore, if the workers coordinate, they accept all profitable tasks
 and obtain the maximal profits.
 However, each individual worker 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 capacity constrained (in time), and thus has the option value of rejecting.
 Therefore, when workers act independently, they accept fewer tasks and
 make less profits.
