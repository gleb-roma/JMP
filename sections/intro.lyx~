The existing economics literature mainly focused on two-sided pricing to
 influence participation on the sides of the market.
 But many new marketplaces, such as Uber and Airbnb, are transactional matching
 marketplaces, in which the matching stage, which occurs after the stage
 of affiliation with the platform, matters a lot.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The new platforms, such as Uber and Airbnb, set the goal of bringing the
 idle capacities possessed by dispersed owners to the market where they
 can be efficiently traded.
 These platforms are dynamic matching marketplaces, that is characterized
 by the following features: the participants' preferences can be highly
 heterogenous, supply is limited in the short run, and the market runs continuou
sly.
 Therefore, bringing the owners to the platform is only half of the problem,
 because capacity may end up being under-utilized in the matching stage
 even when all participants are formally affiliated with the platform.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The platform operator has limited number of design tools at its disposal
 because it acts as an intermediary whose goal is to facilitate search and

New platforms, such as Uber and Airbnb, were created with the aspiration

 These platforms facilitate search and transactions in order to match the
 capacities with potential buyers.
 Typically, in matching marketplaces, where heterogeneity is pronounced,
 the information provision is the key because it improves matching efficiency.
 Yet information availability increases workers' ability to screen potential
 buyers.
 The precise characterization and various consequences of this tradeoff
 constitute the theme of the present paper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
First we show that in a matching marketplace with independent workers and
 stochastic buyer arrival, information availability creates undersirable
 competition among worker for better buyers which results in wasted capacity.
 Therefore, the intermeidary can improve matching by coarsening the information
 about buyers visible to the workers.

New platforms, such as Airbnb and Upwork, were created with the aspiration
 of bringing to the market the idle capacities possessed by dispersed owners.
 These platforms are matching marketplaces in the sense that both buyer
 and worker preferences are potentially highly heterogenous (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "DELS14,Fradkin2014,CFwp,Horton2015"

\end_inset

).
 Hence a platform's goal is to facilitate search and transactions between
 buyers and workers.
 In markets with pronounced heterogeneity, the information provision is
 the key because it improves matching efficiency (e.g.

\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 Yet information availability also gives service providers more control
 over the matching process, grants them more market power that may lead
 to inferior market outcomes.
 This creates a tradeoff between matching efficiency and rent-seeking.
 The precise characterization and various consequences of this tradeoff
 constitute the theme of the present paper.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I develop a model of a 
\emph on
dynamic peer-to-peer market 
\emph default
in which buyers arrive stochastically and request services from workers;
 a participating worker has heterogenous matching value across buyers (e.g.,
 heterogenous costs but posted price), his capacity is limited
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A distinguishing feature of a peer-to-peer marketplace relative to a retailer
 from the perspective of a consumer is the presence of heterogeneous sellers
 or goods with limited capacity or availability.
 (Fradkin 2016)
\end_layout

\end_inset

, and he is free to accept or reject buyer requests.
 Coarse segmentation of buyer tasks degrades matching quality for workers
 but also expands the set of equilibrium outcomes, namely it eliminates
 undesirable cream-skimming competition among workers.
 As a result, capacity utilization may increase.
 A combination of these two effects is that generically there exists a coarse
 segmentation of tasks on which the worker profits increase.
 Furthermore, buyers are also better off because higher capacity utilization
 implies shorter delays for buyers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dynamic peer-to-peer markets are increasingly relevant: there has been a
 10-fold growth in worker participation in online platforms over the last
 3 years (JP Morgan Chase, 2016).
 Nowadays 19% of the total US adult population has engaged in a sharing
 economy transaction (2015, PWC); Airbnb now lists more rooms than the three
 largest hotel chains combined (Fradkin); Uber has more drivers than taxi
 drivers in US.
 By 2025, online talent platforms could boost global GDP by $2.7 trillion
 (McKinsey, 2015).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many existing platforms have the problem of failed matches.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 finds that hosts on Airbnb reject proposals to transact by searchers 49%
 of the time.
 Using TaskRabbit data (from June 2010 to May 2014), 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 find that only 49% of posted tasks were successfully completed.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 provides empirical evidence from online labor market UpWork that information
 asymmetry about workers capacity impacts the formation of matches in important
 ways.
 Part of the failed matches occurs due to workers' picking out buyers

 reports that on Airbnb 20% of requests fail due to hosts' cream-skimming.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 In this paper I study how the platform can use segmentation of buyer tasks
 to improve the utilization rates, where utilization is defined as the fraction
 of the aggregate service providers' capacity being used on average.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Uber addressed the cream-skimming problem by limiting drivers rejection
 rate, and additionally hiding some passenger information from drivers,
 such as ride destination.
 Airbnb is also aware of the problem of worker low acceptance rate, and
 as a solution, introduced Instant Book feature.
 In my framework, a host who adopted Instant Book faces a single segment
 of guests so that he cannot discriminate among them.
 Airbnb is now working on fine tuning the Instant Book feature that would
 allow hosts to use a somewhat finer consumer segments.
 The natural question is how fine these segments should be allowed to be?
 TaskRabbit design defaults workers into accepting incoming tasks, so that
 rejecting tasks is harder because it requires additional actions.
 Moreover, TaskRabbit does not collect task details from customers before
 directing them to the search results.
 Offline markets which possess the same features as peer-to-peer platform
 are housing market, where the real-estate agency is the intermediary.

In firm-worker matching markets, individual firms may find it beneficial
 to engage in sequential rounds of interviews.

\begin_layout Standard
In a peer-to-peer market, coarsening the segmentation of consumer tasks
 can improve utilization rates.
 Workers can discriminate only across segments, and thus coarser segments
 limit the extent of discrimination.
 For intuition, consider a simple static example: there is one worker, his
 hourly rate 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is posted in advance but the costs across potential tasks are heterogenous.
 The worker's optimal strategy is to accept all tasks with cost below 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and reject the tasks with cost above 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 The intermediary can increase the worker's acceptance rate by grouping
 tasks right above 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 with the tasks below 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 into one segment.
 The worker infers his expected cost for the segment.
 If the segment contains sufficiently many low-cost tasks, the average cost
 of a task from the segment is low enough, so that the worker is willing
 to accept a random task from the segment.
 Consequently, for any fixed price, the platform can increase the utilization
 rate by coarsening the segments of buyer tasks.
 This simple example, however, does not explain how segmentation influences
 the worker dynamic optimization problem and competition between workers,
 therefore we can't evaluate the equilibrium effect of segmentation and
 can't study implications for the welfare.
 Also in the example I assumed that the platform has complete information
 about the worker's cost, which would be a strong assumption in many application
s.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Coarse segmentation may improve worker profits because information availability
 creates undesirable competition among workers for better buyers.
 Workers choose to keep their schedule open by ignoring low-return jobs
 in order to increase their individual chances of receiving high-return
 jobs.
 I call this behavior
\emph on
 dynamic cream-skimming.

\emph default
 Collectively, this behavior is sub-optimal for workers because all profitable
 jobs should be completed to maximize the joint profits.
 Dynamic cream-skimming results in wasted capacity and lowered worker profits.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, I characterize the optimal segmentation for the intermediary that
 wants to maximize total matches, as a function of worker cost heterogeneity
 and the distribution of workers' productivity.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Minimal example of dynamic cream-skimming.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Suppose there are two identical workers.
 Every time period 
\begin_inset Formula $t=1,2,...$
\end_inset

 one task arrives.
 Each task has profit 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi=1$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi=1/5$
\end_inset

 with equal probabilities.
 The new task is directed to one of the available workers chosen uniformly
 at random.
 If the worker accepts the task, he works on it the next period and does
 not receive new tasks.
 Each worker maximizes the all-time average profit; there is no discounting.
 I will compare two situations: in the first, the workers coordinate to
 maximize the joint profits, in the second, the workers play a blind Nash
 equilibrium.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When the workers coordinate, it is optimal to accept every task.
 The expected per period profit for each worker is then 
\begin_inset Formula $V^{o}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}(1+\frac{1}{5})=.3$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Now consider a Nash equilibrium in which workers do not observe each other
 states and act independently.
 I claim that a pair of strategies where each worker accepts only 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi=1$
\end_inset

 is such an equilibrium.
 Indeed, in this equilibrium, expected per period profit for each worker
 must be 
\begin_inset Formula $V^{*}=1/4$
\end_inset

.
 Suppose a worker receives a task with profit 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi=1$
\end_inset

.
 If he accepts the task, he earns 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 over the course of two periods.
 If he rejects the task, he earns zero today and expects to earn 
\begin_inset Formula $V^{*}$
\end_inset

 tomorrow.
 Therefore the net payoff of accepting 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi=1$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $1-1/4=3/4>0$
\end_inset

, and so tasks 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi=1$
\end_inset

 are accepted.
 Analogously, we find that the net payoff of accepting 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi=1/5$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $1/5-1/4<0$
\end_inset

, and so tasks 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi=1/5$
\end_inset

 are rejected.
 We conclude that the equilibrium outcome is not optimal for the workers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The platform can increase the workers' profits by not revealing the value
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

.
 Then the expected profit of each task is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}(1+\frac{1}{5})=.6>0$
\end_inset

, and so every task is accepted.
 This attains the optimum.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This example shows that in peer-to-peer markets, independent service providers
 engage in self-defeating cream-skimming competition which results in lower
 profits compared to the case when workers coordinate.
 Fundamentally, this happens because jointly the workers are less capacity
 constrained than individually.
 In the example above, it is physically possible for workers to complete
 every buyer task (No Excess Demand assumption in the main model), and so
 collectively, the workers are not capacity constrained.
 Therefore, if the workers coordinate, they accept all profitable tasks
 and obtain the maximal profits.
 However, each individual worker 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 capacity constrained (in time), and thus has the option value of rejecting.
 Therefore, when workers act independently, they accept fewer tasks and
 make less profits.

 This paper necessarily focuses on a limited set of digital marketplace
 design choices.
 Other mechanisms also play an important role in these markets.
 Reputation systems reveal seller quality in ways that reduce both adverse
 selection and moral hazard on the part of sell- ers (Resnick et al.
 (2000), Klein, Lambertz and Stahl (Forthcoming), Fradkin et al.
 (2015)).
 Innovative pricing and matching mechanisms such as auctions (Einav et al.
 (Forthcoming), employer initiated search (Horton (Forthcoming)), and surge
 pricing (Hall, Kendrick and Nosko (2016)) are frequently used to clear
 the market.
 The informational structure of the market, including the ability to post
 photos (Lewis (2011)) and disclose quality (Tadelis and Zettelmeyer (2015)),
 can also affect market eciency.

First, vis-a-vis literature on pricing in two-sided platform (

 Second, vis-a-vis DAA literature which studies the centralized matching
 mechanism (kidney exchange, National Resident Matching Program), the markets
 I am interested in feature less control by the intermediary.
 The distinguishing feature of a peer-to-peer market is that a participant
 can typically decide whether to participate in a transaction or not after
 learning his counter-party.
 Intermediation in peer-to-peer platforms is therefore akin to regulation
 and anti-trust policies in industries.

 They showed that when product differentiation increases, buyers search
 more.
 However, the total effect on price elasticity of demand is ambiguous.
 In the present paper the workers do not search but reject or accept incoming

 Information coarsening decreases buyer task differentiation.
 On the one hand, workers are worse off because due to lack of information

 On the other hand, information coarsening softens cream-skimming competition

 Theoretical results in this literature such as Burdett, Shi and Wright

 uses data from eBay to study ranking algorithms for differentiated products.
 In the framework of this paper, their Best Match algorithm is de-conflation
 of vertically differentiated goods.
 By making price a more important feature in search results, the goods are
 effectively grouped into price categories, so that it is now easier for
 buyers to find lower-priced goods.

 and Hagiu and Wright (2016) that study the question of the intermediary's
 span of control in the platform it's running.
 There, the focus is on who, the platform or sellers, engages in complimentary
 activities (marketing, advertising).
 My explanation focuses on the matching mechanics and underscores the importance
 of buyer delays and supply heterogeneity in supply-demand fit.

 Compared to them, the game the workers play in my model is asynchronous,
 there is no hidden common state but there are private types which are not
 observed by the intermediary.

This result illustrates the more general connection between Bayes correlated
 equilibrium and Bayes Nash equilibrium for all information structures studied
 in Bergemann and Morris (2016 TE), where we showed that a joint distribution
 over actions and states is Bayes correlated equilibrium if and only if
 it forms a Bayes Nash equilibrium distribution under some information structure.
