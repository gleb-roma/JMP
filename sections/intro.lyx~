A primary objective for matching platforms, such as platforms for transportation
 (Uber, Lyft, Turo), housing rental (Airbnb, Craigslist), and labor contracting
 (Upwork, TaskRabbit, temp agencies), is to facilitate value-creating transactio
ns.
 Providing detailed information to the market participants about the goods
 or trading partners is a way to ensure that they identify and pursue the
 most valuable matches.
 Indeed, matching platforms spend significant resources eliciting match-relevant
 information from the users and incorporating it into the platform's design.

 I study the information intermediation problem in the context of the following
 model.
 Buyers and sellers try to match on the platform but the match value is
 uncertain.
 Buyers contact sellers
\change_inserted -484307115 1485911422
 in continuous time
\change_unchanged
, who then review buyer attributes and choose whether 
\change_inserted -484307115 1485910299
or not 
\change_unchanged
to accept
\change_deleted -484307115 1485910303
 or reject
\change_unchanged
 them.
 Buyers are short-lived and must match quickly, but they are indifferent
 as to which seller they match with.
 Sellers are long-lived, have limited capacity for serving buyers and derive
 heterogeneous payoffs from being matched with different buyers.
 In particular, not all matches are profitable.
 If a seller accepts a buyer, the seller becomes unavailable for a fixed
 period 
\change_deleted -484307115 1486064310
of time
\change_unchanged
 and cannot consider new buyers.
 The platform designs an information disclosure policy that governs which
 buyer attributes are disclosed to sellers before they 
\change_deleted -484307115 1485910428
decide whether to 
\change_unchanged

 The first main result of the paper is that full information disclosure
 is inefficient.
 Specifically, there is a strategy profile for the sellers that generates
 higher surplus for both buyers and sellers than in the market equilibrium
 under full disclosure.
 There are two components for this inefficiency: inefficiency on the buyer
 side of the market and inefficiency on the seller side of the market.
 The driving force for inefficiency on the buyer side is that the set of
 matches that create positive surplus for the sellers is distinct from the
 set of matches that create positive surplus for the buyers.
 Sellers do not internalize buyer surplus when they make decisions whether
 or not to accept the buyers' requests.
 Disclosing more information to sellers reduces the platform's ability to
 induce sellers to accept the efficient matches.
 The sellers will single out the matches that are valuable to them and reject
 other matches that are potentially valuable to the buyers.

 The inefficiency of full disclosure on the seller side of the market is
 perhaps more surprising since each individual seller in isolation clearly
 benefits from more information.
 The fact that sellers become worse off as a whole is a consequence of the
 seller coordination failure.
 In a market where sellers act independently, each seller keeps his schedule
 open by rejecting low-value matches in order to increase his individual
 chances of getting high-value matches.
 As a result, sellers spend significant time waiting for high-value matches.
 Collectively, this behavior is suboptimal because both low- and high-value
 matches have to be accepted in order to maximize the joint seller surplus.
 I attribute the source of the coordination failure to what I call the 
\emph on
cream-skimming externality
\emph default
: By rejecting a buyer, a seller remains available on the marketplace and
 attracts a fraction of subsequent buyers who otherwise would contact  other
 sellers.
 As a result, the other sellers face fewer valuable buyers and realize lower
 profits.
 The cream-skimming externality arises  when sellers have correlated preferences
 over buyers, have limited capacity for serving buyers and are forward-looking.
 The platform's policy of withholding of information reduces the sellers'
 ability to cream-skim and allays the externality.
 In the second part of the paper, I study how the information disclosure
 affects market outcomes and characterize the efficient disclosure policy.

 In this model, a key tradeoff emerges between match quality and match rate.
 Full disclosure of information need not be optimal, because information
 disclosure can negatively affect the match rate and partially or wholly
 offset the positive effect on the match quality.
 Seller profit is a product of match quality and match rate, and buyer surplus
 is an increasing function of the match rate.
 So, the seller profit function does not align with the platform's objective.
 Specifically, profit-maximizing sellers will 
\emph on
cream-skim
\emph default
 and reject inefficiently many buyers.
 Unlike sellers, the platform cares about welfare on both sides of the market,
 and so efficient disclosure is coarse if the negative effects of information
 disclosure on the match rate are strong.
 This paper considers how the optimal disclosure policy depends on the details
 of the seller side of the market.

 Efficiency requires that both match quality and match rate be high.
 Seller profit is larger when both are high, whereas buyer surplus is large
 when the match rate is high.
 However, match quality and match rate are in conflict.
 Enforcing higher match rates compromises quality, because sellers are forced
 to accept inferior matches.
 Similarly, allowing sellers to cherrypick the most valuable buyers leads
 to higher rejection rates and lower match rates.
 For example, if Uber drivers reject passenger requests more often, passengers
 will have longer wait times.
 On Airbnb, if hosts reject guest inquiries more frequently, guests must
 spend more time searching.

The optimal disclosure policy must balance three effects: the positive effect
 on the seller quality of the match and the negative static and dynamic
 effects on the match rate.
 First, the effect of disclosure on the match quality is straightforward.
 From a seller’s point of view, more information increases his set of attainable
 payoffs.
 Holding the match rate fixed, he benefits from more information about buyers.
 Second, information disclosure reduces the platform’s ability to induce
 sellers to accept buyers.
 A key observation is that the platform can increase a seller's expected
 marginal profit by limiting the information revealed to him.
 To see why, note that pooling marginally profitable buyers (which are rejected
 because the seller would prefer to wait for a better buyer) with inframarginal
 buyers (which are accepted) alters the seller's expected marginal profit.
 Ignoring dynamic effects, higher marginal profit induces sellers to accept
 more buyers, which leads to higher match rates.
 Third, making more information available to a seller increases returns
 on his search.
 Indeed, since acceptance precludes further search, the opportunity cost
 of accepting a given buyer is higher.
 As a result, sellers reject buyers more often, and the match rate goes
 down.
 This dynamic effect on the match rate exists only when sellers have limited
 capacity and are forward looking.
 The match-quality effect provides a motive for the platform to disclose
 information, while the match-rate effects provide a motive to limit information.
\change_inserted -484307115 1486064778
The optimal disclosure policy must balance three effects of information
 disclosure: the positive effect on the sellers’ match quality and the negative
 static and dynamic effects on the match rate.
 On the one hand, the effect of information disclosure on the match quality
 is straightforward.
 From a seller’s point of view, more information increases his set of attainable
 payoffs.
 Holding the match rate fixed, he benefits from more details about buyers.
 On the other hand, information disclosure reduces the platform’s ability
 to induce sellers to accept more matches.
 The effect on match rate has static and dynamic components.
 The static component is standard for the information disclosure literature,
 but the dynamic component is novel.
 To understand the static component, represent the seller’s problem as a
 tradeoff between quantity (acceptance rate) and profit (match quality).
 In the optimum, a seller chooses the acceptance rate such that the expected
 profit from the marginal buyer is zero.
 A key observation then is that the platform can increase the seller’s expected
 marginal profit by limiting the information revealed to him.
 To see why, note that pooling marginally profitable buyers (which are rejected
 because the seller would prefer to wait for a better buyer) with inframarginal
 buyers (which are accepted) alters the seller’s expected marginal profit.
 Ignoring dynamic effects, higher marginal profit induces sellers to accept
 more buyers, which leads to higher match rates.
 The dynamic effect of disclosure on match rate stems from the fact that
 making more information available to a seller increases his return on the
 search.
 Indeed, although releasing more information to a seller expands his set
 of attainable payoffs, it also increases his opportunity cost of accepting
 any given buyer—since acceptance precludes receiving further buyer requests.
 As a result, sellers reject buyers more often, and the match rate goes
 down.
 The dynamic effect on the match rate only exists when sellers have limited
 capacity and are forward-looking.
 The match-quality effect provides a motive for the platform to disclose
 information, while the match-rate effects provide a motive to withhold
 information.

 Note that by the Revelation Principle, two signals is sufficient because
 sellers have two actions.

\change_unchanged
 
\change_deleted -484307115 1486047333
The welfare-maximizing policy is the intermediate case between the buyer-optimal
 disclosure policy and the seller-optimal disclosure policy.
 To maximize the buyer surplus, coarsening is necessary, because sellers
 underweight the match rate relative to buyers in their payoff functions.
 The higher the buyer search costs (and thus the costlier the rejections),
 the coarser the optimal disclosure policy.
 Perhaps more surprisingly, when maximizing the joint seller profits, the
 optimal disclosure is also coarse.

\change_inserted -484307115 1486062480
 If the platform does not observe the sellers' preferences, a simple mechanism
 with two recommendations will no longer be efficient, because it is impossible
 to tailor two incentive compatible recommendation to different sellers.

 The question of finding an optimal disclosure policy is a non-trivial problem,
 and there are three main challenges in analyzing it.
 First, I do not restrict the class of disclosure policies in any way, that
 is I allow for arbitrary mappings from buyer characteristics to signals
 sent to sellers.
 This makes the problem multi-dimensional.
 Second, the seller preferences might have unobserved heterogeneity.
 Finally, the sellers are forward-looking, which as it turns out, prevents
 me from using the standard approaches in the literature on information
 disclosure.
 In the third point lies the main technical contribution of the paper.
 When sellers are forward-looking, the information disclosure policy determines
 not only the seller’s stage payoff but also his continuation value.
 In turn, continuation value depends on the distribution of future expected
 payoffs.
 As a result, a seller’s decision to accept depends not only on the posterior
 mean of the current buyer type—which is a standard feature in the existing
 models—but on the entire signaling structure.
 In this situation, the concavification approach of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "KG11"

\end_inset

 and the linear programming approach of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Kol15"

\end_inset

 are unsuitable for the analysis of this problem.
 My approach consists of three steps.
 First, I represent signaling structures as a particular class of convex
 functions.
 Second, I use the calculus of variations to find the first-order conditions
 of optimality.
 Third, I use this first order necessary condition on convex functions to
 back out the optimal information policy (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).

The adverse effect of disclosure on joint seller profits is a form of seller
 coordination failure.
 In a marketplace where sellers act independently, each seller keeps his
 schedule open by rejecting low-value matches to increase his own chances
 of getting high-value matches.
 As a result, sellers spend significant time waiting for high-value matches.
 Collectively, this behavior is suboptimal because both low- and high-value
 matches have to be accepted in order to maximize the joint profits.
 I attribute the source of the coordination failure to what I call the 
\emph on
cream-skimming externality
\emph default
: By rejecting a buyer, a seller remains available on the marketplace and
 attracts a fraction of subsequent buyers who otherwise would move to other
 sellers.
 As a result, the other sellers face fewer valuable buyers and realize lower
 profits.
 The cream-skimming externality arises only when sellers have limited capacity
 and are forward looking.
 When this externality is present, sellers underestimate the effect of their
 own acceptance rate on the platform-wide match rate

 and collectively resolve the tradeoff between match quality and match rate
 suboptimally.
 The platform's policy of limiting information decreases the option value
 of rejection and can increase the match rate to the seller-optimal level.

When sellers are unobservably heterogeneous, the optimal disclosure policy
 is finer than in the case of identical sellers.
 With heterogeneous sellers, the effect of information disclosure on match
 quality is stronger, but there are important subtleties.
 Coarse disclosure tailored to increase one seller’s acceptance rate can
 drive another seller’s average profit below zero and violate his individual
 rationality constraint.
 If any coarsening is optimal in this case, the degree of coarsening is
 now not obvious.
 The optimal policy should accommodate the possibly opposite reactions of
 different sellers to disclosure and will depend on the shape of the seller
 type distribution.

 Buyers and sellers have one-dimensional continuous types, seller match

\change_inserted -484307115 1486065233
 Note that a policy with upper-coarsening is pinned down by a cutoff in

\change_inserted -484307115 1486061079

 the buyer surplus.
 If the buyer-to-seller ratio is high or the sellers are more capacity constrain
ed, then the cutoff is interior (the pooling part is not empty), and so
 some coarsening is optimal.
 Conversely, if the buyer-to-seller ratio is low and the sellers are loosely
 constrained, then the cutoff is corner (the pooling part is empty), and
 so the full disclosure is optimal.

The optimal disclosure policy in my setting with capacity constrained sellers
 is qualitatively different from the one when sellers are unconstrained.
 The best way to see the difference is to contract policies in the situation
 when the platform maximizes the match rate.
 With unconstrained sellers, information disclosure does not affect the
 match rate (

The paper is related to the broader literature of information disclosure
 in markets.
 The seminal papers of Akerlof 1970 and Hirschleifer 1971 highlighted possible
 opposing effects of coarse information on welfare (adverse selection and
 risk-sharing, respectively).
 In advertising, the effect of better targeting is ambiguous because it
 affects both demand and supply.
 On the one hand, better targeting increases demand for advertising.
 On the other hand, it decreases competition on the supply side (
