The Model of Decentralized Matching Market
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section I lay out a model of a decentralized matching market, in
 which buyers arrive gradually over time and pursue sellers by proposing
 a job; sellers have heterogenous preferences over buyers, seller capacities
 are limited, and sellers independently choose what matches to accept.

Spot matching process.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are three parties involved in the search and matching process: sellers,
 buyers and the platform itself.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is mass 1 of sellers, who always stay on the platform, never leave
 or arrive.
 The sellers do not actively look for jobs, but instead screen the buyer
 requests: each worker is presented with a sequence of job offers at Poisson
 rate, and he decides whether to accept or reject them to maximize discounted
 profit flow.
 An accepted job takes time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 to complete, during which time the seller cannot receive new jobs.
 
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is the search friction.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 At each moment a seller is either available and waits for new jobs, or
 busy with working on a job.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a continuum of potential buyers who gradually arrive over time
 at flow rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
 That is, within a time interval 
\begin_inset Formula $dt$
\end_inset

, mass 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta dt$
\end_inset

 of buyers arrive to the platform.
 Each buyer has a single job he wants to be completed.
 Upon arrival, the buyer proposes the job to one of the available sellers.
 I assume that the target seller is drawn uniformly at random from the pool
 of available workers.
 If the buyer's job is accepted, the buyer stays until the job is completed,
 otherwise he leaves the platform.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assume 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\tau<1$
\end_inset

 which implies that collectively, it is physically possible for sellers
 to complete every buyer job.
 The assumption makes the exposition easier and relaxing it requires more
 notation to deal with either automatic rejections or queues.
 I do this in  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Extensions"

\end_inset

 and show that qualitatively results do not change.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The platform opts out of the centralized matching process, instead it makes
 disclosure of buyer characteristics part of its design, as described below.

Buyer and seller preference heterogeneity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two dimensions of heterogeneity in the matching market.
 First, each seller has heterogeneous match payoff across buyers.
 Second, different seller have different payoff functions over jobs.
 Concerning the platform's information disclosure problem, I need the following
 pieces of notation.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 be buyer type, with the interpretation that 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is the buyer characteristics 
\bar under

\bar default
 by the platform.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Buyer type 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 captures the payoff-relevant information the platform elicits from the
 buyer about the job, passively from the buyer's cookies and queries or
 actively by asking questions.
 For example, on Uber, 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 would include rider's destination; on Airbnb, 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 would include guest's race, age and gender.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The space of buyer types 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 is a compact subset of Euclidean space.
 Distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 with full support.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 be seller type, with the interpretation that 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 is the seller characteristics 
\bar under
unobserved
\bar default

\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 status, race, etc.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The space of seller types 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 is a compact subset of Euclidean space.

\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $G$

\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is differentiable on 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 Seller profit for one match is 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(x,y)$
\end_inset

.
 Assume 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 is continuous and for any 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 there is 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(x,y)>0$
\end_inset

.
 Buyer net match payoff is 
\begin_inset Formula $u(x,y)$
\end_inset

.
 Assume that all incoming buyers have non-negative match payoff:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
u(x,y)\geq0.\label{eq:buyer-net-payoff}

 Full disclosure policy, denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda^{FD}$

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda'$

\begin_inset Formula $\lambda''$
\end_inset

 That is, the platform can obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda'$

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda''$
\end_inset

 by taking 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda''$
\end_inset

 and partially concealing some

 When a buyer of type 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 arrives, the platform draws a signal according to 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 and shows it to the seller.
 The seller knows the platform's choice of

\begin_layout Paragraph
Steady state distribution of sellers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A steady state of the matching process is characterized by the fraction
 of available sellers of every type and their acceptance rates.
 Formally, let 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha(y)\geq0$
\end_inset

 be the acceptance rate of type-
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 available sellers, and let 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(y)$
\end_inset

 be the type-
\begin_inset Formula $y$

\emph on
 utilization rate
\emph default
 – the fraction of type-
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 sellers who are busy.
 Denote the total fraction of busy sellers by 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\rho}:=\int_{Y}\rho(y)dG(y)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a steady state, the flow of sellers who become busy is equal to the flow
 of workers who become available.
 The available-to-busy flow is equal to the buyer flow type-
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 sellers receive times their acceptance rate.
 Since buyer get distributed uniformly across the available sellers, the
 buyer flow to type-
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 sellers is 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\frac{(1-\rho(y))g(y)}{1-\bar{\rho}}$
\end_inset

.
 The acceptance rate is 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha(y)$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the available-to-busy flow is 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\frac{(1-\rho(y))g(y)}{1-\bar{\rho}}\alpha(y)$
\end_inset

.
 The busy-to-available flow is 
\begin_inset Formula $g(y)\rho(y)/\tau$
\end_inset

 because the mass of busy 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

-sellers is 
\begin_inset Formula $g(y)\rho(y)$
\end_inset

, and jobs are completed in time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, in a steady state, we have:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\beta\frac{(1-\rho(y))g(y)}{1-\bar{\rho}}\alpha(y)=\frac{g(y)\rho(y)}{\tau},\quad\forall y\in Y.\label{eq:SS}

Seller dynamic screening problem.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Buyers arrive at flow rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 and get distributed uniformly at random across all available sellers.
 Therefore, each individual available seller experiences a Poisson arrival
 process of buyers, where the rate of the arrival is equal to the buyer-to-selle
r ratio:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\beta_{A}:=\frac{\beta}{1-\bar{\rho}}\label{eq:beta_A-1}

).
 There is thus a contrast between individual arrival process and aggregate
 arrival process in that the individual arrival process is stochastic while
 the aggregate arrival process is deterministic (a consequence of law of
 large numbers).
 More concretely, an individual seller faces a stochastic arrival process,
 such that over an infinitesimal time interval 
\begin_inset Formula $dt$
\end_inset

 the probability that one buyer arrives is 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{A}dt+o(dt)$
\end_inset

 Jointly, available sellers face the deterministic buyer arrival process,
 such that over time interval 
\begin_inset Formula $dt$
\end_inset

 the continuum mass 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{A}dt$
\end_inset

 of buyers arrive.
 As we show in the rest of this section, stochasticity of individual arrival
 process combined with independent decision-making creates seller coordination
 problem which results in matching inefficiency.

Seller strategy is function

I am interested in a steady state equilibrium of the market in which the

 Recall that the exogenous objects in my model are: buyer flow rate

\begin_inset Formula $\pi(x,y)$

, distribution of types 
\begin_inset Formula $G(y)$

\begin_layout Proposition
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset

Steady-state equilibrium exists.
 It is unique up to the acceptance of marginal jobs in the follwing sense.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $(\sigma^{i},\brho^{i})$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,2$
\end_inset

 are two steady-state equilibria, then (1) 
\begin_inset Formula $\brho^{1}=\brho^{2}$
\end_inset

, and (2) for any 
\begin_inset Formula $y\in Y$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{1}(\cdot,y)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2}(\cdot,y)$
\end_inset

 coincide except on 
\begin_inset Formula $\{s\colon\pi(s,y)=\tau V(y)\}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the proof in the Appendix, first, I show that for an arbitrary vector
 of acceptance rates 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha(y)$
\end_inset

, there is a unique steady state value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\brho$
\end_inset

.
 Then, average utilization 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\rho}$
\end_inset

 is increasing and continuous in 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha(y)$
\end_inset

 for any 
\begin_inset Formula $y\in Y$
\end_inset

.
 The uniqueness of equilibrium obtains by monotonicity of reaction curves
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\rho}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\rho}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

.
 Namely, in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "eq:alpha"

\end_inset

, as buyer traffic intensity 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{A}$
\end_inset

 increases, sellers become more picky and acceptance rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha(y)$
\end_inset

 decreases.
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha(y)$
\end_inset

 increases, buyers get directed to a smaller set of sellers, hence 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{A}$
\end_inset

 increases.

\begin_layout Standard
In this section I discuss how the model maps to the reality in the case
 of Uber, Airbnb and labor platform such as TaskRabbit.
 Recall that 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 denotes seller type, i.e.
 the seller's unobserved heterogeneity; 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 denotes buyer type, i.e.
 the information about buyer available to the platform.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
There is an equivalent phrasing of the model which for some real world applicati
ons might be more relevant than the original phrasing.
 In the original phrasing, a buyer first reveals his information 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 to the platform, then the platform coarsely matches 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 to signal 
\begin_inset Formula $s=\lambda(x)$
\end_inset

, and finally 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 is communicated to sellers.
 Alternatively, I can phrase the model in a different way.
 Type 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 captures all cost-relevant information the buyer possesses.
 The platform's disclosure policy is then a mechanism that partially elicits
 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 from a buyer.
 That is, the platform gets to observe only 
\begin_inset Formula $s=\lambda(x)$
\end_inset

, and then 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 is communicated to sellers.
 For example, the platform asks three questions about a buyer need, which
 imperfectly describes what the buyer wants.
 In this reinterpretation, the platform's information coarsening corresponds
 to coarse elicitation of buyer information.

Discussion of the Modeling Assumptions

\begin_layout Standard
In this subsection I discuss in detail the important assumptions of my model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Assumption
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "assu:single-search-attempt"

\end_inset

Buyers make a single search attempt.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rejection-intolerant buyers is a simplifying assumption that help to avoid
 endogenous distribution of buyer types.
 It captures the real aspect of matching markets that rejections are costly
 to buyers, e.g.
 wasted time, wasted search effort, bidding costs, etc.
 Moreover, buyers often do take rejections badly.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Fra15"

\end_inset

 reports that on Airbnb, an initial rejection decreases the probability
 that the guest eventually books any listing by 50%.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Assumption
Buyers contact available sellers only.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of the paper is to explore the matching frictions that pertain
 to preference heterogeneity and screening.
 Therefore, I assume away the coordination frictions owing to several buyers
 requesting the same seller and the coordination frictions owing to buyer
 requesting unavailable sellers.
 All three types of matching frictions are present in the matching marketplaces

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 The coordination frictions in matching markets have been extensively studied
 in the theoretical literature (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "BSW01,Kir09,Halaburda2013,AJK14"

\end_inset

), and I assume away this channel of matching inefficiency to focus on screening.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Assumption
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "assu:uniform-assignment"

\end_inset

Buyers contact an available seller chosen uniformly at random
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This assumption has two implications.
 First, seller of any type faces the same intensity of buyer traffic.
 Second, each seller faces the same distribution of buyer jobs.
 This is a simplifying assumption that helps me to focus sellers excessive
 screening problem.
 In the extension 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 seller type can be different.
