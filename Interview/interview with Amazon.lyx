\begin_layout Itemize
My work experience has consisted of being a TF as well as a researcher.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I was a TF for the past three years for an introductory econometrics course
 at Harvard.
 When I was first selected for the job, the professors told me that the
 course didn't have detailed structure, but I saw the position as an opportunity
 to innovate and create my own coursework.
 My vision was to excite my students and provide a good classroom experience.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I studied the section notes from the previous years, and extracted important
 information, added examples and questions that would allow for detailed
 discussion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Then, when I used the handouts for the first time, students said it was
 very helpful.
 We were able to engage in spirited discussions based off of the examples.
 It was easier for them to follow the class because ...
 The handouts facilitated different levels of students' learning.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I was glad to see that it helped students to better understand the material.
 But I also learnt from the experience, because the students would dive
 deeper into the material and ask more meaningful questions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Also, I work closely with my advisors.
 One time I was an RA for Susan Athey where she wanted me to improve a model
 in the bitocion paper 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
edited the framework so that it maps reality better but it also maked a
 more elegant model.
