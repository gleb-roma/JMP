Hello, today I am presenting my 
\series bold
job
\series default
 market paper where I study how 
\series bold
limiting
\series default
 
\series bold
information
\series default
 can 
\series bold
improve
\series default
 
\series bold
performance
\series default
 of decentralized matching markets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To fix ideas, I will start by 
\series bold
phrasing
\series default
 my research question in the context of 
\series bold
Airbnb
\series default
.
 Then I will show that my 
\series bold
findings
\series default
 apply more 
\series bold
generally
\series default
, to many 
\series bold
other
\series default
 decentralized matching markets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Airbnb is a marketplace that's matching 
\series bold
guests
\series default
 and 
\series bold
hosts
\series default
.
 In a 
\series bold
typical
\series default
 interaction, a guest 
\series bold
searches
\series default
 over available listings and sends inquiries to those he likes.
 Hosts search passively.
 A host 
\series bold
reviews
\series default
 the guest request and 
\series bold
accepts
\series default
 it only if he 
\series bold
likes
\series default
 the guest.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It sounds nice and efficient but there is a problem.
 If hosts reject too 
\series bold
often
\series default
, they slow 
\series bold
down
\series default
 the 
\series bold
guest
\series default
 side of the market.
 By 
\series bold
rejecting
\series default
, hosts 
\series bold
waste
\series default
 the guests' 
\series bold
time
\series default
 and 
\series bold
search
\series default
 efforts.

[This is what I will call the cross-side search externality.

\end_layout

\end_inset

 And 
\series bold
indeed
\series default
, we observe on Airbnb data that hosts often prefer to remain 
\series bold
unmatched
\series default
 rather than accept someone (20% as found by Fradkin 2015).
 Now, suppose that Airbnb's objective is to maximize total welfare on the
 platform, where welfare includes both guest and hosts value from 
\series bold
matches,
\series default
 
\series bold
and
\series default
 
\series bold
also disutility
\series default
 from 
\series bold
search
\series default
 efforts and 
\series bold
wasted time
\series default
.
 Then 
\series bold
excessive search
\series default
 is a problem for Airbnb because even if the participants 
\series bold
find
\series default
 the most 
\series bold
valuable
\series default
 matches, the 
\series bold
search
\series default
 costs are too 
\series bold
high
\series default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, Airbnb is a digital marketplace and controls most aspects of the matching
 system.
 In particular, it controls the information guests and hosts see about each
 other on their profiles.
 
\series bold
Question
\series default
: Can Airbnb design an information disclosure policy to alleviate the problem
 of excessive search and improve efficiency of the marketplace? For example,
 Airbnb hosts screen guests based on guest gender, socio-economic status,
 day schedule, race, personality, messiness, star rating, reviews, etc.
 How much communication between hosts and guests should be allowed? What
 guests attributes should be made visible and others less visible? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
standard
\series default
 intuition suggests that to increase 
\series bold
matching value
\series default
, the designer wants hosts and guests to disclose the 
\series bold
maximum
\series default
 of relevant 
\series bold
information
\series default
 about themselves, so that the participants of the marketplace can 
\series bold
find
\series default
 and 
\series bold
form
\series default
 the 
\series bold
most
\series default
 
\series bold
valuable
\series default
 matches.
 However, abundance of information about match value can also have 
\series bold
negative
\series default
 effects on welfare.
 More information about guests increases the perceived diversity of guests
 and induces more search on the host side.
 More search is inefficient if the guests and hosts preference are not perfectly
 aligned.
 For example, there is a conflict if guests are less picky than hosts but
 are more time-sensitive.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In my paper, I show how a policy of 
\emph on
coarse
\emph default
 revelation of guest information can be used to alleviate the excessive
 search problem and improve the efficiency of the marketplace.
 For example, ...
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The high-level intuition for the simplest case of static matching with 1
 worker comes from standard papers on information disclosure (AM95 and KG11).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What's missing in this simple example is the actual dynamic nature of matching
 and heterogeneity of host audience â€“ which both should be taken into account
 while building the optimal information disclosure policy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To capture the dynamism and heterogeneity I build a model of a decentralized
 matching marketplace...

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My framework applies more broadly to many others decentralized matching
 markets.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Let me tell you what I mean by this.
 When hosts 
\series bold
reject
\series default
 guest requests, they impose 
\series bold
externalities
\series default
 on 
\series bold
guests
\series default
 
\series bold
and
\series default
 the 
\series bold
other
\series default
 workers.
 First, when a host rejects, the guest's time and search effort is wasted.
 As a result , when workers 
\series bold
screen
\series default
 guests, they 
\series bold
slow down
\series default
 the guest side of the market.
 Second, when a host rejects, his listing remains active on the marketplace
 and presents competition to other workers.
 Ok, these were the two search externalities I am focusing on in my paper.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A natural reaction here would be to tax the externalities, for example,
 charge a fee from a host when he rejects.
 This is not really feasible because it creates the unsafe marketplace,
 and also it's hard to calculate the exact fee amount.
