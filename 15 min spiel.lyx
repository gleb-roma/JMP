.
 We know that when buyers and sellers are heterogeneous, providing information
 about the trading partners is key because it lets the market participants
 form the most 
\series bold
valuable
\series default
 matches.
 However, more information also makes the participants pickier, and this
 decreases the 
\series bold
rate
\series default
 at which the matches are formed.
 As a result, information availability slows down the matching that leads
 to lower surplus in the markets where speed matters.
 In this situation, the platform's strategic decision to limit information
 the participants observe about each other will be welfare-improving.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let me give you an example.
 In Uber marketplace, a driver receives requests from passengers and has
 an option to accept or reject each request.
 In the current version of UberX the drivers see the passenger's rating,
 name and location but do 
\series bold
not
\series default
 see the passenger's destination until after the driver picks up the passenger.
 Well, the drivers 
\series bold
care
\series default
 about where the passenger is going.
 Typically, the drivers don't like doing short trips or traveling to remote
 neighborhoods where it's hard to get another passenger.
 The quesion is: Is there a case for such information withholding to improve
 the

 of the marketplace?

\begin_layout Standard
In my paper, I study this question in 
\bar under
a general framework 
\bar default
that applies also to matching platforms for housing rental and labor contracting
, such as Airbnb and TaskRabbit.
 In my model, buyers contact sellers and want to match quickly.
 Sellers recieve buyer requests and choose what buyers to accept and whom
 to reject.
 The sellers have limited capacity for serving buyers and most importantly,
 seller have preferences over buyers.
 The platform chooses a disclosure policy on the seller side of the market,
 namely it chooses how to reveal buyer characteristics to the sellers.
 I allow for arbitrary disclosure policies, that is, for an aribtrary mapping
 from buyer types to signals.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have three main results.
 First, I show that full disclosure of buyer characteristics is Pareto-inefficie
nt.
 In the second and the third, I characterize the optimal disclosure policy
 in different environments.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\bar under
For example,
\bar default
 Back to the Uber example, a disclosure policy governs what passenger characteri
stics are revealed to the driver and how coarsely.
 Full disclosure is the one when Uber shows the exact passenger destination.
 A coarse disclosure would be, for example, to partition all destination
 into three categories, close ride, medium-range ride, far ride, and show
 to the driver only the category the destination belongs to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\bar under
My first main result is that under the full disclosure, a combination of
 buyer and seller surpluses is Pareto-inefficient.
 
\bar default
Let me tell you why, first, for the buyers, then, for the sellers.
 Revealing buyer information to sellers stimulates sellers to cream-skim.
 Specifically, sellers will single out the matches valuable to them but
 reject other matches that are valuable to the buyers.
 Therefore, disclosing to sellers may hurt buyer surplus.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Disclosing less information makes sellers less picky, they settle for less
 and tend to accept more matches.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[A key observation is that the platform can increase a seller's expected
 marginal profit by limiting the information revealed to him.
 To do so, it should pool the attractive jobs with marginally unattractive
 jobs putting more weight on attractive jobs.
 Marginally unattractive are the jobs that are marginally profitable and
 are rejected because a seller prefers to wait for a better job.
 Attractive jobs are the profitable jobs that are accepted.
 ]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, what is more interesting is that information availability also makes
 sellers worse off as a whole.
 Intuitively, each seller keeps his schedule open by rejecting the low-value
 matches in order to increase his individual chances of getting the high-value
 matches.
 As a result, the sellers spend a lot of time waiting for the most valuable
 buyers.
 Collectively, this behavior is suboptimal because all seller-valuable matches
 have to be accepted in order to maximize the joint seller surplus.
 The platform's policy of withholding the buyer information reduces sellers'
 cream-skimming behavior, and improves the efficiency of the marketplace.

[Let me tell you the exact model I am working in.

\bar default
 There are three groups of players: buyers, sellers, and the platform itself.
 Buyer search for sellers, they don't care who they match with but want
 to match quickly.
 Sellers receive buyer requests and choose what buyers to accept and whom
 to reject.
 The sellers have limited capacity for serving buyers, derive heterogeneous
 payoffs from being matched with different buyers, maximize their average
 profit flow, and don't care about match rate per se.
 The platform is information intermediary between buyers and sellers.
 It designs an information disclosure policy that governs what buyer characteris
tics sellers see before accepting a match.

Now let me move on to the next part of the paper where I study the optimal
 disclosure policy.

\bar default
 The optimal disclosure policy depends on the details of the seller side
 of the market, and I study this question in two environments.
 
\begin_inset Note Note
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the whole generality, the matching payoffs have a complex structure because
 there are 4 sources of heterogeneity in matching payoffs: both buyer and
 seller characteristics potenially affect both buyer and seller payoffs,
 and the platform only partially observes each source of heterogeneity.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

The first environment is where the platform knows the sellers' preferences;
 and the second environment is where the seller preferences are unknown
 to the platform.
 
\end_layout

the general question of when a matching platform should limit information
 that its users see about each other, and I show that to improve total surplus
 the platform should limit information.
 I also characterize the optimal disclosure policy in several environments.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Note Note
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Why is limiting information welfare improving? The key tradeoff for a matching
 platform is between match quality and match rate.
 Let me return to my Uber example.
 The base effect goes as follows.
 On the one hand, disclosing more information to an Uber driver increases
 his ex ante match quality because he can choose what's better for him.
 On the other hand, it may decrease the match rate.
 Lower match rate means longer wait times.
 Passengers do not like waiting, and so low match rate hurts passenger surplus.
 Therefore, limiting information can increase match rate and increase buyer
 suprlus more than it hurts the seller surplus.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
I have three main results.
 First, I show that the full information disclosure is inefficient.
 Second, I show that when the platform knows seller preferences, then there
 is a disclosure policy that restores the full efficiency, and this policy
 is very coarse.
 Finally, as my main technical contribution, I characterize the optimal
 disclosure policy in the case when sellers have distinct preferences over
 buyers which are unknown to the platform.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\bar under
Now let me tell you in more detail why the full disclosure is not efficient.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Disclosing more buyer information to sellers increases sellers' 
\series bold
return on search
\series default
.
 As a result, sellers will 
\series bold
cream-skim
\series default
: They reject low-value buyers to chase the high-value buyers.
 Even though seller match 
\series bold
quality
\series default
 
\series bold
increases
\series default
, the match 
\series bold
rate
\series default
 can go 
\series bold
down
\series default
.
 For sellers it's fine.
 But for the platform it is not fine, because it also cares about the buyers
 who disproportionately value high match rate.
 In other words, in the full-disclosure equilibrium sellers resolve the
 match qualityâ€“match rate tradeoff inefficiently.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\bar under
Let me start with the case of known seller preferences.

\bar default
 I show that there is a very coarse disclosure policy that implements an
 economic outcome with both higher buyer and seller surpluses.
 
\begin_inset Note Note
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
limiting information restores the full efficiency, where the full efficiency
 is when all efficient matches and only them are formed.
 This is gonna be my second main result.
 As I just told you, full disclosure is not efficient.
 It turns out that the disclosure policy that restores efficiency is very
 coarse.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 For any given buyer, this disclosure policy sends to the seller one of
 two signals: either a
\series bold
 
\series default
recommendation to accept or a recommendation to reject.
 In fact, with the right choice of signals, the implemented outcome is Pareto-ef
ficient in the sense that is no other seller strategy profile that generates
 higher buyer and seller surplus.
 How to choose the signals? Take a Pareto-efficient outcome that dominates
 the full disclosure outcome.
 By the Revelation Principle, it is sufficient to recommend seller to accept
 the matches that lead to this Pareto-efficient outcome, and recommned to
 reject the others.
 The sellers follow the recommendations because the platform knows seller
 preferences.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\bar under
Now let me tell you about my main technical contribution, which is the case
 of unobservable seller preferences.
 
\bar default
In the whole generality, the matching payoffs have a complex structure because
 there are 4 sources of heterogeneity in matching payoffs: both buyer and
 seller characteristics potenially affect both buyer and seller payoffs.
 Therefore I restrict my attention to the setting where seller payoff is
 a linear function of seller and buyer type, and buyers have no preference
 over sellers.

\begin_inset Formula $v(x,y)=y-x$

\begin_inset Formula $u(x,y)=u$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 High seller typesâ€”call them professionalsâ€”can profitably complete a larger
 set of buyer tasks than low seller typesâ€”call them amateurs.
 The platform does not know if a given seller is a professional or an amateur,
 and this creates an additional tradeoff into the platform's disclosure
 problem.
 Specifically, if the platform was to withhold information in a way I described
 earlier to stimulate the 
\series bold
professionals
\series default
 accept more buyers, the 
\series bold
amateurs
\series default
 would stop working at all.
 To see why, note that the pool of buyers supposed to be accepted by professiona
ls contains a lot of buyers who has negative value for the amateurs.
 Therefore, the amateurs would reject the professional's recommendation
 to accept.
 This logic suggests that the platform should release more information so
 that sellers have information needed to stay profitable on the platform.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And indeed, welare-maximizing disclosure policy in this case is more revealing
 than when seller preferences are known.
 In partiular, I show that the optimal disclosure policy has the form of
 upper-coarsening, in which high buyer types are pooled, and low buyer types
 are perfectly revealed.
 And this is my third main result.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\bar under
Now let me tell you how I solve this disclosure problem.

\bar default
 Building on the information communication literature (Kamenica-Gentzkow
 2011), the platform's problem is a disclosure problem of buyer type to
 an unobservably heterogeneous audience of sellers, who are also forward-looking.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I approach this problem by representing signaling structures as a particular
 class of convex functions and then using the calculus of variations to
 find the first-order necessary conditions.
 The best way to see that the optimal disclosure policy is qualitatively
 different when sellers are forward-looking, consider the uniform distribution
 of seller types and the platform's objective to maximize the average acceptance
 rate.
 In this case, when the sellers are unconstrained, the disclosure policy
 does not affect the matching rate.
 However, when sellers are constrained, the strict optimal disclosure policy
 is upper-coarsening.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this case, the design of the optimal information disclosure is a nontrivial
 problem.
 To see why, note that with forward-looking sellers, the information disclosure
 policy determines not only the sellerâ€™s stage payoff but also the distribution
 of his potential future payoffs.
 As a result, a sellerâ€™s decision to accept depends not only on the posterior
 mean of the buyer typeâ€“which is standard in this literatureâ€”but also on
 the entire signaling structure.
 This makes a typical approaches in the literature, such as concavification
 as in the recent bayesian persuasion literature, is unsuitable for the
 analysis of my model.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In decentralized matching markets it is important that buyers and sellers
 find and form the most valuable matches.
 But it is also important that the matches happen fast.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Let me give you an example.
 On Uber, a driver wants to know the passenger's star rating, where the
 passenger is going and maybe the passenger's gender.
 At first sight, it makes perfect sense for the platform designer to show
 to the driver all information it has about the passenger.
 However, more information increases the return to search and screening.
 The driver will reject low-value rides, such as short rides or rides to
 remote neighborhoods, because he knows there will be more requests coming.
 As a result, the passenger will wait long to get a ride, which decreases
 user experience for passengers.
 Uber is a two-sided market so it cares about both sided, drivers and passengers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
I study how a two-sided platform should design an information disclosure
 policy to alleviate sellers cream-skimming behavior and improve efficiency.
 E.g.
 what passenger attributes on Uber, or guest attributes on Airbnb should
 be made visible to sellers?

Can you say in one sentence what externality a seller imposes by accepting
 or rejecting a match? 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Yes.
 The externality has to do with the constrained capacity.
 When a seller rejects a buyer request, he stays available on the marketplace,
 and attracts a fraction of buyers that otherwise would go to his competitiors.
 As a result, the other sellers face a weaker demand, and are worse off.

Is there a differential sense to your first result? If I decrease information
 a little bit, does it necessarily increase the surplus? 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Yes, I can tell you the differential result.
 The short answer is that the effect on surplus depends on how exactly you
 restrict the information.
 In a generic case, there is always a perturbation to full disclosure that
 increases the surplus and a perturbation that decreases the surplus.

Buyers have types, which are relevant for sellers (destination on Uber).
 The platform maps buyer types into signals, and shows to sellers only the

 If all possible desitnation locations are broken down into three groups,
 then there are just three signals.
 Such a disclosure policy is quite coarse.

 The approach is quite general and can be applied to other disclosure problems.
 Especially it will be useful in the situations where the receivers optimal
